- Properly implement history for back/forward work. Probably just trigger a redraw?  Detect different URL and reload?

- Don't specify URL in table; always use same as graph?

- Don't specify URL in graph, hard coded URL. Why would user mess with? Or maybe make it its own field somewhere?

- Zoom on the graph is wonky.

- Need a button to return to all users.
	- Or better, a "Total" entry at the top of the chart.

- Buttons/tabs for window
	- Day/Week/Month
	- Now (different data?) Pie charts?

-  Pool view
	Load averages
	memory usage
	cpu usage
	Idle CPUs? Claimed CPUs?

- Canned views no edit; tab for custom

- Button to autoupdate

- How to do cumulative user time?

- history.pushState with relative URLs for simplicty?
	- Chrome hates pushState on file: URLs. Maybe relatiev will fix?

- Rename colums for human friendlyness

- Stub in columns after a pivot (if we pivot on State and there are no Preempting, but we want one anyway, just fill it with zeros)

- Limit precision on avg.  New function/operation? Javascript probably just mynumber.toFixed(X) where X is number of places.  Although round may work faster. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11832914/round-to-at-most-2-decimal-places-in-javascript

- Sort Name using locale or something; currently ASCII/Unicode, so capital before lower.

- "Download this table" displays table directly on Safari. Internet suggests no current workaround.  _Might_ be able to use application/octet-stream as the type to force download, but still won't have a filename.
