- CSV, maybe XLSX downloads. Probably data URI, set window.location to it to for download. Use download="filename.csv" in the href tag. http://cwestblog.com/2014/10/21/javascript-creating-a-downloadable-file-in-the-browser/

- Properly implement history for back/forward work. Probably just trigger a redraw?  Detect different URL and reload?

- Don't specify URL in table; always use same as graph?

- Don't specify URL in graph, hard coded URL. Why would user mess with? Or maybe make it its own field somewhere?

- Zoom on the graph is wonky.

- Zome data just wonky on the graph. Try "undefined" as a user. Violations of time and space.

- Need a button to return to all users.

- Buttons/tabs for window
	- Day/Week/Month
	- Now (different data. Pie charts?

-  Pool view
	Load averages
	memory usage
	cpu usage
	Idle CPUs? Claimed CPUs?

- Canned views no edit; tab for custom

- Button to autoupdate

- How to do cumulative user time?

- history.pushState with relative URLs for simplicty?
	- Chrome hates pushState on file: URLs. Maybe relatiev will fix?

- Rename colums for human friendlyness

- Stub in columns after a pivot (if we pivot on State and there are no Preempting, but we want one anyway, just fill it with zeros)

- Limit precision on avg.
