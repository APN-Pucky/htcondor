==========

HTCondor provides five main Docker images on Docker Hub:

* ``htcondor/minicondor``, a stand-alone HTCondor configuration
* ``htcondor/cm``, an image configured as a central manager
* ``htcondor/execute``, an image configured as an execute node
* ``htcondor/submit``, an image configured as a submit node
* ``htcondor/base``, an unconfigured "base" image

These images share the same set of tags:

* ``something``, ....
* ``something``, ....
* ``something``, ....

[do we bother to mention ``htcondor/build-<osname>``?]
