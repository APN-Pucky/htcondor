.. _admin_install_macosx:

Mac OS X (as root)
==================

To install HTCondor on Mac OS X, run the following commands:

.. code-block:: shell

    # [FIXME]

You can check to see if the install procedure succeeded; the following commands
should complete without errors:

.. code-block:: shell

  condor_q
  condor_status

The output will look something like this:

.. code-block:: console

  $ condor_q
  [stuff]
  $ condor_status
  [stuff]
