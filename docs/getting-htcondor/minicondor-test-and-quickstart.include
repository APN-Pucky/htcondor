You can check to see if the install procedure succeeded; the following commands
should complete without errors:

.. code-block:: shell

    # FIXME
    condor_q
    condor_status

The output will look something like this:

.. code-block:: console

    $ condor_q
    [FIXME]
    $ condor_status
    [FIXME]
