Mac OS X (as user)
==================

To install HTCondor on Mac OS X, run the following commands:

.. code-block:: shell

    # [FIXME]

You'll need to run the following command now, and every time you log in:

.. code-block:: shell

    . ~/condor/install/condor.sh

.. include:: minicondor-test-and-quickstart.include
