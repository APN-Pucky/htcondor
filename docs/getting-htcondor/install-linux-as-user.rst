Linux (as user)
===============

To install HTCondor on Linux as a normal user, run the following commands:

.. code-block:: shell

    # [FIXME]

You'll need to run the following command now, and every time you log in:

.. code-block:: shell

    . ~/condor/install/condor.sh

.. include:: minicondor-test-and-quickstart.include
