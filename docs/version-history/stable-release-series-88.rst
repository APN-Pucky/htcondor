Stable Release Series 8.8
=========================

This is the stable release series of HTCondor. As usual, only bug fixes
(and potentially, ports to new platforms) will be provided in future
8.8.x releases. New features will be added in the 8.9.x development
series.

The details of each version are described below.

Version 8.8.3
-------------

Release Notes:

-  HTCondor version 8.8.3 is scheduled for release on June 4, 2019.

New Features:

-  The performance of HTCondor's File Transfer mechanism has improved when
   sending multiple files, especially in wide-area network settings.
   :ticket:`7000`

-  If ``MAXJOBRETIREMENTTIME`` evaluates to ``-1``, it will truncate a job's
   retirement even during a peaceful shutdown.
   :ticket:`7034`

Bugs Fixed:

-  Fixed a bug that prevented HTCondor from being started inside a docker
   container with the condor_master as PID 1.  HTCondor could start 
   if the master was launched from a script.
   :ticket: `7017` 

-  Fixed a bug with singularity jobs where TMPDIR was set to the wrong
   value.  It is now set the the scratch directory inside the container.
   :ticket:`6991`

-  Fixed a bug when pid namespaces where enabled and vanilla checkpointing
   was also enabled that caused one copy of the pid namespace wrapper to wrap
   the job per each checkpoint restart.
   :ticket:`6986`

-  Fixed a bug where the memory usage reported for Docker Universe jobs
   in the job classad and job event log could be underestimated.
   :ticket:`7049`

-  ``condor_off -peaceful`` will now work by default (and whenever
   ``MAXJOBRETIREMENTTIME`` is zero).
   :ticket:`7034`

Version 8.8.2
-------------

Release Notes:

-  HTCondor version 8.8.2 released on April 11, 2019.

New Features:

-  Added a new parameter ``SINGULARITY_IS_SETUID``
   :index:`SINGULARITY_IS_SETUID`, which defaults to true. If
   false, allows *condor_ssh_to_job* to work when Singularity is
   configured to run without the setuid wrapper. :ticket:`6931`

-  The negotiator parameter ``NEGOTIATOR_DEPTH_FIRST``
   :index:`NEGOTIATOR_DEPTH_FIRST` has been added which, when
   using partitionable slots, fill each machine up with jobs before
   trying to use the next available machine. :ticket:`5884`

-  The Python bindings ``ClassAd`` module has a new printJson() method
   to serialize a ClassAd into a string in JSON format. :ticket:`6950`

Bugs Fixed:

-  Support for the *condor_ssh_to_job* command, when ssh'ing to a
   Singularity job, requires the nsenter command. Previous versions of
   HTCondor relied on features of nsenter not universally available.
   8.8.2 now works with all known versions of nsenter. :ticket:`6934`

-  Moved the execution of ``USER_JOB_WRAPPER``
   :index:`USER_JOB_WRAPPER` with Singularity jobs to be executed
   outside the container, not inside the container. :ticket:`6904`
-  Fixed a bug where *condor_ssh_to_job* would not work to a Docker
   universe job when file transfer was off. :ticket:`6945`

-  Included a patch from the development series that fixes problems that
   could crash *condor_annex* to crash. :ticket:`6980`

-  Fixed a bug that could cause the ``job_queue.log`` file to be
   corrupted when the *condor_schedd* compacts it. :ticket:`6929`

-  The *condor_userprio* command, when given the -negotiator and -l
   options used to emit the value of the concurrency limits in the one
   large ClassAd it printed. This was removed in 8.8.0, but has been
   restored in 8.8.2. :ticket:`6948`

-  In some situations, the GPU monitoring code could disagree with the
   GPU discovery code about the mapping between GPU device indices and
   actual devices. Both now use PCI bus IDs to establish the mapping.
   One consequence of this change is that we now prefer to use NVidia's
   management library, rather than the CUDA run-time library, when doing
   discovery. :ticket:`6903`
   :ticket:`6901`

-  Corrected documentation of ``CHIRP_DELAYED_UPDATED_PREFIX``; it is
   neither singular nor a prefix. Also resolved a problem where
   administrators had to specify each attribute in that list, rather
   than via prefixes or via wildcards. :ticket:`6958`

-  The Condormaster now waits until the *condor_procd* has exited
   before exiting itself. This change helps to prevent problems on
   Windows with using the Service Control Manager to restart the Condor
   service. :ticket:`6952`

-  Fixed a bug on Windows that could cause a delay of up to 2 minutes in
   responding to *condor_reconfig*, *condor_restart* or *condor_off*
   commands when using shared port. :ticket:`6960`

-  Fixed a bug that could cause the *condor_schedd* on Windows to to
   restart with the message "fd_set is full". This change reduces that
   maximum number of active connections that a *condor_collector* or
   *condor_schedd* on Windows will allow from 1023 to 1014. :ticket:`6957`

-  Fixed a bug where local universe jobs where unable to run
   *condor_submit* to their local schedd. :ticket:`6920`

-  Restored the old Python bindings for reading the job event log
   (``EventIterator`` and ``read_events()``). These bindings are marked
   as deprecated, are not available in Python 3, and will likely be
   removed permanently in the 8.9 series. Users should transition to the
   replacement bindings (``JobEventLog``) :ticket:`6939`

-  Fixed a bug that could cause entries in the job event log to be
   written with the wrong job id when a *condor_shadow* process is used
   to run multiple jobs. :ticket:`6919`

-  In some situations, the bytes sent and bytes received values in the
   termination event of the job event log could be reversed. This has
   been fixed. :ticket:`6914`

-  For grid universe jobs of type ``batch``, the job now receives a
   signal when the batch system wants it to exit, giving the job a
   chance to shut down gracefully. :ticket:`6915`

Version 8.8.1
-------------

Release Notes:

-  HTCondor version 8.8.1 released on February 19, 2019.

Known Issues:

-  GPU resource monitoring is no longer enabled by default after we
   received reports indicating excessive CPU usage. We believe we've
   fixed the problem, but would like to get updated reports from users
   who were previously affected. To enable (the patched) GPU resource
   monitoring, add 'use feature: GPUsMonitor' to the HTCondor
   configuration. Thank you.
   :ticket:`6857`

-  Discovered a bug in DAGMan where graph metrics reporting could
   sometimes send the *condor_dagman* process into an infinite loop. We
   worked around this by disabling graph metrics reporting by default,
   via the new ``DAGMAN_REPORT_GRAPH_METRICS``
   :index:`DAGMAN_REPORT_GRAPH_METRICS` configuration knob.
   :ticket:`6896`

New Features:

-  None.

Bugs Fixed:

-  Fixed a bug that caused *condor_gpu_discovery* to report the wrong
   value for DeviceMemory and possibly other attributes of the GPU when
   CUDA 10 was installed as the default run-time. Also fixed a bug that
   would sometimes cause the reported value of DeviceMemory to be
   limited to 4 Gigabytes. :ticket:`6883`

-  Fixed bug that prevented HTCondor on Windows from running jobs in the
   default configuration when started as a service. :ticket:`6853`

-  The Job Router no longer sets an incorrect ``User`` job attribute
   when routing a job between two *condor_schedd* s with different
   values for configuration parameter ``UID_DOMAIN``. :ticket:`6856`

-  Made Collector.locateAll() method more efficient in the Python
   bindings. :ticket:`6831`

-  Improved efficiency of negotiation code in the *condor_schedd*.
   :ticket:`6834`

-  The new ``minihtcondor`` package now starts HTCondor automatically at
   after installation. :ticket:`6888`

-  The *condor_master* now sends status updates to *systemd* every 10
   seconds. :ticket:`6888`

-  *condor_q* -autocluster data is now much more up-to-date. :ticket:`6833`

-  In order to work better with HTCondor 8.9.1 and later, remove support
   for remote submission to *condor_schedd* s older than version
   7.5.0. :ticket:`6844`

-  Fixed a bug that would cause DAGMan jobs to fail when using Kerberos
   Authentication on Debian or Ubuntu. :ticket:`6917`

-  Fixed a bug that caused execute nodes to ignore config knob
   ``CREDD_POLLING_TIMEOUT``\ :index:`CREDD_POLLING_TIMEOUT`.
   :ticket:`6887`

-  Python binding API method Schedd.submit() and submitMany() now edits
   job ``Requirements`` expression to consider the job ad's
   ``RequestCPUs`` and ``RequestGPUs`` attributes. :ticket:`6918`

Version 8.8.0
-------------

Release Notes:

-  HTCondor version 8.8.0 released on January 3, 2019.

New Features:

-  Provides a new package: ``minicondor`` on Red Hat based systems and
   ``minihtcondor`` on Debian and Ubuntu based systems. This
   mini-HTCondor package configures HTCondor to work on a single
   machine. :ticket:`6823`

-  Made the Python bindings' ``JobEvent`` API more Pythonic by handling
   optional event attributes as if the ``JobEvent`` object were a
   dictionary, instead. See section `Python
   Bindings <../apis/python-bindings.html>`_ for details. :ticket:`6820`

-  Added job ad attribute ``BlockReadKbytes`` and ``BlockWriteKybtes``
   which describe the number of kbytes read and written by the job to
   the sandbox directory. These are only defined on Linux machines with
   cgroup support enabled for vanilla jobs. :ticket:`6826`

-  The new ``IOWait`` attribute gives the I/O Wait time recorded by the
   cgroup controller. :ticket:`6830`

-  *condor_ssh_to_job* is now configured to be more secure. In
   particular, it will only use FIPS 140-2 approved algorithms. :ticket:`6822`

-  Added configuration parameter ``CRED_SUPER_USERS``, a list of users
   who are permitted to store credentials for any user when using the
   *condor_store_credd* command. Normally, users can only store
   credentials for themselves. :ticket:`6346`

-  For packaged HTCondor installations, the package version is now
   present in the HTCondor version string. :ticket:`6828`

Bugs Fixed:

-  Fixed a problem where a daemon would queue updates indefinitely when
   another daemon is offline. This is most noticeable as excess memory
   utilization when a *condor_schedd* is trying to flock to an offline
   HTCondor pool. :ticket:`6837`

-  Fixed a bug where invoking the Python bindings as root could change
   the effective uid of the calling process. :ticket:`6817`

-  Jobs in REMOVED status now properly leave the queue when evaluation
   of their ``LeaveJobInQueue`` attribute changes from ``True`` to
   ``False``. :ticket:`6808`

-  Fixed a rarely occurring bug where the *condor_schedd* would crash
   when jobs were submitted with a ``queue`` statement with multiple
   keys. The bug was introduced in the 8.7.10 release. :ticket:`6827`

-  Fixed a couple of bugs in the job event log reader code that were
   made visible by the new JobEventLog python object. The remote error
   and job terminated event did not read all of the available
   information from the job log correctly. :ticket:`6816`
   :ticket:`6836`

-  On Debian and Ubuntu systems, the templates for
   *condor_ssh_to_job* and interactive submits are no longer
   installed in ``/etc/condor``. :ticket:`6770`
