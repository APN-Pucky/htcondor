Upgrading from the 8.8 series of HTCondor to the 9.0 series will bring
new features introduced in the 8.9 series of HTCondor. These new
features include the following (note that this list contains only the
most significant changes; a full list of changes can be found in the
version history: \ `Development Release Series
8.9 <../version-history/development-release-series-89.html>`_):

-  Feature 1 :ticket:`0000`
-  Feature 2

Upgrading from the 8.8 series of HTCondor to the 9.0 series will also
introduce changes that administrators and users of sites running from an
older HTCondor version should be aware of when planning an upgrade. Here
is a list of items that administrators should be aware of.

-  ALLOW_DAEMON does not inherit from ALLOW_WRITE
-  DISABLE_SETUID
-  If EXECUTE and/or LOCAL_UNIV_EXECUTE are on NFS with root squash,
permissions on these subdirectories will need to be changed from the
default of 0755 to 1777.
