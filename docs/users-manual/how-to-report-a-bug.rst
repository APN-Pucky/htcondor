How to Report a Bug
===================

You can report a bug via our various Technical Support channels, as described
on our main website:

https://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/htcondor-support/


Mailing List
------------

A good place to start is asking about your problem on our community mailing
list: htcondor-users@cs.wisc.edu

This is actively used by both HTCondor developers and the wider community, so
people will identify if your problem is a known issue, a new problem, or not
a bug at all. We'll also be able to offer solutions and short-term workarounds.


Email Support
-------------

If the mailing list fails to provide a solution, send an
email directly to our group at htcondor-admin@cs.wisc.edu. Please provide as
much information as possible: detailed information about the problem, relevant
log files, and steps on how to reproduce it. If it's a new issue that our
team was not aware of, we'll create a new ticket in our system.


Ticketing System
----------------

Experienced HTCondor users can also request a user account that will allow
them to create tickets directly in our system:

https://htcondor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/rptview?rn=4

To get an account, send an email to htcondor-admin@cs.wisc.edu explaining why
you want it and how you intend to use it. These are typically reserved for 
known collaborators with a direct contact on the HTCondor team.
