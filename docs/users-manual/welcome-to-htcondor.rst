HTCondor is developed by the Center for High Throughput Computing at the
University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW-Madison), and was first installed as
a production system in the UW-Madison Computer Sciences department in 
the 1990s. HTCondor pools have since served as a major source of
computing cycles to thousands of campuses, labs, organizations and 
commercial entities. For many, it has revolutionized the role computing 
plays in their research. An increase of several orders of magnitude in 
the computing throughput of a organization can have a profound impact on
their results.
