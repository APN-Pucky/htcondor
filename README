OVERVIEW

	We use a CloudFormation template to help track all the moving parts
(and clean them up when we're done).  There are other moving parts:

* The AutoScaling Group itself, which defines a particular bloviation.
* A custom metric for that AutoScaling group, whose namespace includes
	the ASG's name.
* A CloudWatch alarm which triggers when the custom metric becomes 0 or
	misses enough updates.  The triggered action is the Lambda function.
	This alarm is identical in all bloviations, but since it watches
	a different metric in each, it must be distinctly instantiated.
* An SNS topic, which names the channel between the alarm(s) and the Lambda
	function.  This topic may be shared between different bloviations.
* A Lambda function, the same for all bloviations, which when triggered
	by the alarm deletes the AutoScaling Group specified in the namespace
	thereof.
* A Lambda function, defining a custom resource, that adjusts the permissions
	on the previous Lambda function so that the SNS topic can invoke it when
	the alarm triggers and calls it.

FIXME

[] The lease Lambda function should (also) delete the stack.
[] Template should include at least one IAM role for the Lambda functions.
[] Since we need to upload the first metric instance before the lease will
   function, it'd be nice to able to (optionally) name the ASG ahead of time.
   Consider another custom resource whose defining Lambda function writes the
   first tick, instead.
[] Subscriptions seem to leak when deleting the stack.
[] Lambda permissions granted to the SNS topic are too wide.
[] Add the standard AWS Linux AMIs and mappings.
[] Figure out what to do about launch configurations...
   take one as a parameter, for now?
[] Configure the retries for the lease Lambda function.  (It doesn't block
   on the reconfigure, and that could take a while.)  May become obsolete
   with stack deletion.
[] The logs from the Lambda functions should expire (fairly quickly).
[] Lease function should catch notfound exception and succeed.

FEATURE REQUESTS

* Invoke[*?] star permissions granted by Lambda function to SNS topic
  creating the subscription in CF.
* CF should check parameter validity earlier and write out constraint
  failure message next to the parameter.
