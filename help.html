<p>Transforms are applied in order. The last entry should be a chart type.  If no chart is specified, a table view of the data is shown.

<dl>


<dt>limit=<em class="variable">n</em></dt>
<dd>
Discard all data after <em class="variable">n</em> rows.</dd>

<dt>filter=<em class="variable">key</em>>=<em class="variable">value1</em>,<em class="variable">value2</em>,...</dt>
<dd>
Show only rows where the column named <em class="variable">key</em> has a
value >= <em class="variable">value1</em> or <em class="variable">value2</em> etc.  The
operator (>= in this example) can be one
of =, &lt;, >, &lt;=, >=, &lt;>, or !=.  If you specify more
than one value, they
are combined in an OR configuration (ie. a row matches
if any of the values match).  If you provide
more than one filter= clause, they are combined
successively in an AND configuration (ie. a row matches
only if all the filters are true).</dd>

<dt>q=<em class="variable">value1</em>,<em class="variable">value2</em>,...</dt>
<dd>
Show only rows where any of the columns contain the
substring <em class="variable">value1</em> or <em class="variable">value2</em> etc.  If more
than one value is specified, they are combined in an OR
configuration.  If you provide more than one q= clause,
they are combined successively in an AND configuration.</dd>

<dt>order=<em class="variable">[-]key1</em>,<em class="variable">[-]key2</em></dt>
<dd>
Sort the table in order of <em class="variable">key1</em> and then (if key1
is the same) by <em class="variable">key2</em> etc.  If a key starts with
'-' that means to sort that key in descending order
(largest to smallest).</dd>

<dt>extract_regexp=<em class="variable">key</em>=<em class="variable">regexp(match)regexp</em></dt>
<dd>
Search for the given regular expression in each row in
the column named <em class="variable">key</em>.  If it's found, replace the
column with the substring in the <em class="variable">(match)</em> part of
the regexp.  For example,
<code>extract_regexp=ver=version-(.*)</code> would replace a
string <code>version-25.4</code> in column <code>ver</code> with the string <code>25.4</code>.</dd>

<dt>group=<em class="variable">key1</em>,<em class="variable">key2</em>,...;<em class="variable">val1</em>,<em class="variable">val2</em>,...</dt>
<dd>
Summarize the table data by summing and counting.  This
operation works like a simplified version of SQL's
"group by" clause.  In the resulting output, the order
of the columns will be
<em class="variable">key1</em>,<em class="variable">key2</em>,...,<em class="variable">val1</em>,<em class="variable">val2</em>... 
and there will only be at most one row with any
particular combination of <em class="variable">key1</em>,<em class="variable">key2</em>,... 
fields.  The <em class="variable">val</em> columns will be summed (if they
were already numerical) or counted (if they were
non-numeric).</p>

<p>A clause like <code>group=a,b;x,y</code> (if x is a string and y
is a number) would be equivalent to this in SQL: <code>select
a, b, count(x) x, sum(y) y from MyTable group by a, b</code></p>

<p>If you apply multiple <b>group=</b> clauses, it works like
using multiple nested subqueries in SQL.  (That is, the
output of one <b>group=</b> clause becomes the MyTable
of the next one.)</p>

<p>If you leave out the ';' and the <em class="variable">val</em> column
names, the default is to automatically include all
columns other than the <em class="variable">key</em> columns.</p>

<p>If you include the ';' but leave out the <em class="variable">val</em>
column names, that means you don't want any value
columns (so only the key fields will be included, and
nothing will be summed or counted at that step).  So
<code>group=a,b;</code> (with a trailing semicolon) is equivalent
to this in SQL: <code>select a, b from MyTable group by a,
b</code>.</dd>

<dt>treegroup=<em class="variable">key1</em>,<em class="variable">key2</em>,...;[<em class="variable">val1</em>,[<em class="variable">val2</em>]]</dt>
<dd>
Like <b>group=</b>, but produces an output table arranged hierarchically
by each <em class="variable">key1</em>..<em class="variable">keyn</em>, so you can drill down.  There can be
zero, one, or two <em class="variable">val</em> columns; the first value is the size of
each box in the tree view (if omitted, they are all the same size), and
the second value is the colour of each box (if omitted, the colour varies
with the size).  <b>treegroup=</b> isn't really useful unless you also
use <b>chart=tree</b>.</dd>

<dt>pivot=<em class="variable">rowkeys...</em>;<em class="variable">colkeys...</em>;<em class="variable">valkeys...</em></dt>
<dd>
A <b>pivot=</b> clause works like a <b>group=</b>
clause, but creates a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pivot_table">pivot table</a>. 
Pivot tables are a bit complicated; the easiest way to
learn about them is to play with an example.
</p>

<p>The simplest way to think of a pivot table is like this:
the values originally in the columns named by <em class="variable">rowkeys</em>
end up down the left of the output table.  The values
originally in the columns named by <em class="variable">colkeys</em> end up
as headings across the top of the output table.  The values
originally in the columns named by <em class="variable">valkeys</em> end up
as values in the body section of the output table.  A
pivot table is very handy when you have raw data in
SQL-like format and you want to rearrange it to be
suitable for charting (where each line in a line chart,
say, is usually one column of the table).</p>

<p>If the <em class="variable">rowkeys</em> section is empty, the output will
have exactly one row (with all the value fields counted
or summed into that one row).  If the <em class="variable">colkeys</em>
section is empty, the <b>pivot=</b> operation is
essentially equivalent to a
<b>group=<em class="variable">rowkeys...</em>;<em class="variable">valkeys...</em></b> operation. 
If the <em class="variable">valkeys</em> section is empty, there are no
values used to calculate the table body, so it is
equivalent to an <b>group=<em class="variable">rowkeys...</em>;</b>
operation.</dd>

<dt>chart=<em class="variable">charttype</em></dt>
<dd>
Instead of showing a table of values, show a chart.  The
available <em class="variable">charttypes</em> are currently: stacked (a
stacked area chart), line, spark, column, bar, pie,
tree (see <b>treegroup</b>), candle, timeline, dygraph, dygraph+errors.</dd>

<dt>title=<em class="variable">title</em></dt>
<dd>
Add a title to the chart.</dd>
