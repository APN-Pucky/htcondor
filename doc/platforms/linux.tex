This section provides information specific to the Linux port of
Condor.
Linux is a difficult platform to support.
It changes very frequently, and Condor has some extremely
system-dependent code (for example, the checkpointing library).

Condor is sensitive to changes in the following elements of the
system: 
\begin{itemize}
\item The kernel version
\item The version of the GNU C library (glibc)
\item the version of GNU C Compiler (GCC) used to build and link
  Condor jobs (this only matters for Condor's Standard universe which
  provides checkpointing and remote system calls)
\end{itemize}

The Condor Team tries to provide support for various releases of the
distribution of Linux.
Red Hat is probably the most popular Linux distribution, and it
provides a common set of versions for the above system components
at which Condor can aim support.
Condor will often work with Linux distributions other than Red Hat (for
example, Debian or SuSE) that have the same versions of the above
components.
However, we do not usually test Condor on other Linux distributions
and we do not provide any guarantees about this.

New releases of Red Hat usually change the versions of some or all of
the above system-level components.
A version of Condor that works with one release of Red Hat might not
work with newer releases.
The following sections describe the details of Condor's support for
the currently available versions of Red Hat Linux on x86 architecture
machines.

Distributions that rely on the Linux 2.4.x and all Linux 2.6.x kernels
through version 2.6.10
do not modify the \Code{atime} of the input device file.
This leads to difficulty when Condor is run using one of these
kernels. 
The problem manifests itself in that Condor cannot properly
detect keyboard or mouse activity.
Therefore, using the activity in policy setting cannot
signal that Condor should stop running a job on a machine.

Condor version 6.6.8 implements a workaround for PS/2 devices.
A better fix is the Linux 2.6.10 kernel
patch linked to from the directions posted at
\URL{http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/kernel.patch.html}.
This patch works better for PS/2 devices, and
may also work for USB devices.
A future version of Condor will implement better recognition
of USB devices,
such that the kernel patch will also definitively work for USB devices.

Condor additionally has problems running on some older Xen kernels,
which interact badly with assumptions made by the \Condor{procd}
daemon. See the FAQ entry in section~\ref{sec:xen-jiffies-bug} for
details.

Modern versions of Red Hat and Fedora include a feature called
\Bold{Exec Shield} that, among other things, randomizes the memory
layout of a process
to reduce the possibility of security exploits. This makes it impossible
for the Standard universe to resume a checkpointed job. When starting
or resuming a Standard universe job, Condor disables the memory
randomization portion of \Bold{Exec Shield}.

If you wish to run a \Condor{compile}d binary in standalone mode
(either initially or in resumption mode), you must manually disable
\Bold{Exec Shield}'s memory randomization by prepending the execution
of your binary with \Bold{setarch i386}.
Here is an example: suppose we have a
Condor-linked binary called \Bold{myapp}. Running this application as a
standalone executable will result in this command: \Bold{setarch i386
myapp}. The subsequent resumption command will be: 
\Bold{setarch i386 myapp -\_condor\_restart myapp.ckpt}.
