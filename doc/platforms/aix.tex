The version of Condor for AIX 5.2L has the same limitations as Condor
for the AIX5.1L platform.

In addition, the Condor binaries for AIX 5.2L will \emph{not} execute on an
AIX 5.1L machine.

\index{platform-specific information!AIX 5.1L}

This is a relatively new port of Condor to the AIX architecture,
and as such there are a few things that are not finished.
Over time, these will be fixed.

Condor limitations on AIX 5.1L:
\begin{itemize}
\item Keyboard Idle and Mouse Idle are wrong.
\item The memory size of threaded programs is reported incorrectly.
\item The memory and usage statistics of completed jobs is sometimes wrong.
\item The standard universe is not supported.
\item The LSF and PBS grid-types of the grid universe are not supported.
\end{itemize}

Note that Condor for the AIX 5.1L machine \emph{will} execute correctly on an
AIX 5.2L machine.
