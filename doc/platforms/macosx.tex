This section provides information specific to the Macintosh OS X port of
Condor.
The Macintosh port of Condor is more accurately a port of Condor to
Darwin, the BSD core of OS X. Condor uses the Carbon library only to
detect keyboard activity, and does not use Cocoa at all.
Condor on the Macintosh is a relatively new port, is not yet well-integrated
into the Macintosh environment.

\index{Platforms !Mac OS 10.3}

Condor \VersionNotice is known to run as well on Panther as well
as Jaguar (10.2). 

Condor on the Macintosh has a few shortcomings:
\begin{itemize}
\item Keyboard Idle is oftentimes wrong. As of Condor \VersionNotice, we still
had not determined why. 
\item Users connected to the Macintosh via ssh are not noticed for console activity.
\item Memory size of threaded programs is reported incorrectly.
\item No Macintosh-based installer is provided.
\item The example startup scripts do not follow Macintosh conventions.
\item Kerberos is not supported.
\end{itemize}
