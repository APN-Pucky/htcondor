This section provides information specific to the Macintosh OS X port of
Condor.
The Macintosh port of Condor is more accurately a port of Condor to
Darwin, the BSD core of OS X. Condor uses the Carbon library only to
detect keyboard activity, and it does not use Cocoa at all.
Condor on the Macintosh is a relatively new port, and it 
is not yet well-integrated
into the Macintosh environment.

Condor \VersionNotice
is known to run on Panther as well
as Jaguar (10.2). 

Condor on the Macintosh has a few shortcomings:
\begin{itemize}
\item Users connected to the Macintosh via \Prog{ssh} are not
noticed for console activity.
\item The memory size of threaded programs is reported incorrectly.
\item No Macintosh-based installer is provided.
\item The example start up scripts do not follow Macintosh conventions.
\item Kerberos is not supported.
\end{itemize}
