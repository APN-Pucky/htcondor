Condor jobs may be submitted to Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)
service.
See the Amazon EC2 webpage at \URL{http://aws.amazon.com/ec2} for more
information about EC2.

Condor jobs are submitted to EC2
using the \SubmitCmd{grid} universe and the
\SubmitCmd{grid\_resource} command  by placing the following
into the submit description file.
\begin{verbatim}
grid_resource = amazon
\end{verbatim}

The amazon grid type requires several parameters to be set in the Condor
configuration file:

\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
AMAZON_GAHP=$(SBIN)/amazon-gahp
AMAZON_GAHP_LOG=/tmp/AmazonGahpLog.$(USERNAME)
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
