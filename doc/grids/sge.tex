The popular Grid Engine batch system (formerly known as Sun Grid Engine and
abbreviated SGE) is available in two varieties:
Oracle Grid Engine
(\URL{http://http://www.oracle.com/us/products/tools/oracle-grid-engine-075549.html})
and Univa Grid Engine
(\URL{http://www.univa.com/?gclid=CLXg6-OEy6wCFWICQAodl0lm9Q}).

Condor jobs are submitted to a local SGE system
using the \SubmitCmd{grid} universe and the
\SubmitCmd{grid\_resource} command by placing the following
into the submit description file.
\begin{verbatim}
grid_resource = sge
\end{verbatim}

The sge grid type requires two variables to be set in the Condor
configuration file.
\Macro{SGE\_GAHP} is the path to the SGE GAHP server binary that is to be
used to submit PBS jobs.
\Macro{GLITE\_LOCATION} is the path to the directory containing the GAHP's
configuration file and auxillary binaries.
In the Condor distribution, these files are located in 
\File{\MacroUNI{LIB}/glite}.
The SGE GAHP's configuration file is in
\File{\MacroUNI{GLITE\_LOCATION}/etc/batch\_gahp.config}.
The SGE GAHP's auxillary binaries
are to be in the directory \File{\MacroUNI{GLITE\_LOCATION}/bin}.
The Condor configuration file appears

\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
GLITE_LOCATION = $(LIB)/glite
SGE_GAHP       = $(GLITE_LOCATION)/bin/batch_gahp
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

%The SGE GAHP's configuration file contains two variables that must be
%modified to tell it where to find PBS on the local system.
%\MacroNI{pbs\_binpath} is the directory that contains the PBS binaries.
%\MacroNI{pbs\_spoolpath} is the PBS spool directory.
