PBS (Portable Batch System) is a popular batch system. It comes in
several varieties: OpenPBS (\URL{http://www.openpbs.org}),
PBS Pro (\URL{http://www.altair.com/software/pbspro.htm}), and
Torque
(\URL{http://www.clusterresources.com/pages/products/torque-resource-manager.php}).

Condor jobs may be submitted to a local PBS system
using the \SubmitCmd{grid} universe and the
\SubmitCmd{grid\_resource} command as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
grid_resource = pbs
\end{verbatim}

Details on where PBS is installed on the local system are
given in the file \$(GLITE\_LOCATION)/etc/batch_gahp.config.
