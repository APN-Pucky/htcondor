%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Unicore is a java-based grid scheduling system. See
\URL{http://unicore.sourceforge.net} for more information about Unicore.

You can submit jobs to Unicore resources using the \SubmitCmd{unicore}
\SubmitCmd{grid\_type} of the grid universe. The semantics are the same as
for other \SubmitCmd{grid\_type}s, except as noted here.

The commands \SubmitCmd{unicore\_u\_site} and \SubmitCmd{unicore\_v\_site}
are required. They specify the name of the Unicore resource to which the
job should be submitted.

Unicore uses certificates stored in a java keystore file for
authentication. Unicore jobs require the following commands that tell
Condor which certificate to use for the job. The command
\SubmitCmd{keystore\_file} specifies the filename of the keystore file to 
use. \SubmitCmd{keystore\_alias} specifies which certificate in the
keystore file to use. \SubmitCmd{keystore\_passphrase\_file} specifies the
path to a file containg the passphrase protecting the certificate in the  
keystore file.
