Platform LSF is a popular batch system. See the Platform LSF web page
(\URL{http://www.platform.com/Products/Platform.LSF.Family})
for more information about LSF.

Condor jobs may be submitted to a local LSF system
using the \SubmitCmd{grid} universe and the
\SubmitCmd{grid\_resource} command as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
grid_resource = lsf
\end{verbatim}

Details on where LSF is installed on the local system are
given in the file \$(GLITE\_LOCATION)/etc/batch\_gahp.config.
