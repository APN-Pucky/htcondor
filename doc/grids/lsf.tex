Platform LSF is a popular batch system. See the Platform LSF web page
(\URL{http://www.platform.com/Products/Platform.LSF.Family})
for more information about LSF.

Condor jobs may be submitted to a local LSF system
using the \SubmitCmd{grid} universe and the
\SubmitCmd{grid\_resource} command as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
grid_resource = lsf
\end{verbatim}

The lsf grid type requires two variables to be set in the Condor
configuration file.
\Macro{LSF\_GAHP} is the path to the LSF GAHP server binary that should be
used to submit PBS jobs.
\Macro{GLITE\_LOCATION} is the path to the directory containing the GAHP's
configuration file and auxillary binaries.
In the Condor distribution, these files are located in \$(LIB)/glite.
The LSF GAHP's configuration file should be located in
\$(GLITE\_LOCATION)/etc/batch\_gahp.config. The LSF GAHP's auxillary binaries
should be located in the directory \$(GLITE\_LOCATION)/bin.

\begin{verbatim}
GLITE_LOCATION = $(LIB)/glite
LSF_GAHP       = $(GLITE_LOCATION)/bin/batch_gahp
\end{verbatim}

The LSF GAHP's configuration file contains two variables that have to be
modified to tell GAHP where to find LSF on the local system.
\Macro{lsf\_binpath} is the directory that contains the LSF binaries.
\Macro{lsf\_confpath} is the location of the LSF configuration file.

%Details on where LSF is installed on the local system are
%given in the file \$(GLITE\_LOCATION)/etc/batch\_gahp.config.
