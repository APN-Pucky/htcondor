\index{ClassAd!job attributes}
%
\item[\AdAttr{CkptArch}] : String describing the architecture of the machine
where this job last checkpointed.  If the job has never checkpointed,
this attribute is UNDEFINED.
%
\item[\AdAttr{CkptOpSys}] : String describing the operating system of
the machine where this job last checkpointed.  If the job has never
checkpointed, this attribute is UNDEFINED.
%
\item[\AdAttr{ClusterId}] : Integer cluster identifier for this job.
%
\item[\AdAttr{ExecutableSize}] : Size of the executable in kbytes.
%
\item[\AdAttr{ImageSize}] : Estimate of the memory image size of the
job in kbytes.  The initial estimate may be specified in the job
submit file.  Otherwise, the initial value is equal to the size of the
executable.  When the job checkpoints, the \AdAttr{ImageSize}
attribute is set to the size of the checkpoint file (since the
checkpoint file contains the job's memory image).
%
\item[\AdAttr{JobPrio}] : Integer priority for this job, set by
\Condor{submit} or \Condor{prio}.  The default value is 0.
%
\item[\AdAttr{JobStatus}] : Integer which indicates the current
status of the job, where 1 = Idle, 2 = Running, 3 = Removed, 4 =
Completed, and 5 = Held.
%
\item[\AdAttr{JobUniverse}] : Integer which indicates the job
universe, where 1 = Standard, 4 = PVM, 5 = Vanilla, and 7 = Scheduler.
%
\item[\AdAttr{LastCkptServer}] : Hostname of the last checkpoint
server used by this job.  When a pool is using multiple checkpoint
servers, this tells the job where to find its checkpoint file.
%
\item[\AdAttr{NiceUser}] : Boolean value which indicates whether
this is a nice-user job.
%
\item[\AdAttr{Owner}] : String describing the user who submitted this
job.
%
\item[\AdAttr{ProcId}] : Integer process identifier for this job.  In
a cluster of many jobs, each job will have the same ClusterId but will
have a unique ProcId.
%
\item[\AdAttr{QDate}] : Time at which the job was submitted to the job
queue.  Measured in the
number of seconds since the epoch (00:00:00 UTC, Jan 1, 1970).
