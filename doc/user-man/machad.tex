	\item[``Busy''] : A job is busy running
	\item[``Suspended''] : A job is currently suspended
	\item[``Vacating''] : A job is currently checkpointing
	\item[``Killing''] : A job is currently being killed
	\item[``Benchmarking''] : The startd is running benchmarks
	\end{description}
%
\item[AFSCell] : If the machine is running AFS, this is a string
containing the AFS cell name.
%
\item[Arch] : String with the architecture of the machine.  Typically
one of the following: 
	\begin{description}
	\item[``INTEL''] : Intel CPU (Pentium, Pentium II, etc).

	\item[``SUN4x''] : A Sun SPARC CPU other than an ULTRASPARC, i.e.
sun4m or sun4c CPU found in older SPARC workstations such as the Sparc\~10, 
Sparc\~20, IPC, IPX, etc.
	\item[``HPPA1''] :  Hewlett Packard PA-RISC 1.x CPU (i.e. PA-RISC    
                      7000 series CPU) based-workstation
	\item[``HPPA2''] :  Hewlett Packard PA-RISC 2.x CPU (i.e. PA-RISC    
                      8000 series CPU) based-workstation
	\end{description}
%
\item[ClockDay] : The day of the week, where 0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday, \Dots, 6 = Saturday. 
%
\item[ClockMin] : The number of minutes passed since midnight.
%
\item[CondorLoadAvg] : The load average generated by Condor (either
from remote jobs or running benchmarks).
%
\item[ConsoleIdle] : The number of seconds since activity on the system
console keyboard or console mouse has last been detected.
%
\item[Cpus] : Number of CPUs in this machine, i.e. 1 = single CPU machine, 2 = dual
CPUs, etc.
%
\item[CurrentRank] : A float which represents this machine owner's affinity
for running the Condor job which it is currently hosting.  If not
currently hosting a Condor job, CurrentRank is -1.0.
%
\item[Disk] : The amount of disk space on this machine available for the
job in kbytes ( e.g. 23000 = 23 megabytes ).  Specifically, this is
amount of disk space available in the directory specified in the Condor 
configuration files by the macro \Macro{EXECUTE}, minus any space reserved
with the macro \Macro{RESERVED\_DISK}.
%
\item[EnteredCurrentActivity] : Time at which the machine entered the 
current Activity (see \AdAttr{Activity} entry above).  Measured in the
number of seconds since the epoch (00:00:00 UTC, Jan 1, 1970).
%
\item[FileSystemDomain] : a domain name configured by the Condor 
administrator which describes a cluster of machines which all access 
the same networked filesystems usually via NFS or AFS.  
%
\item[KeyboardIdle] : The number of seconds since activity on any
keyboard or mouse associated with this machine has last been detected.
Unlike \AdAttr{ConsoleIdle}, \AdAttr{KeyboardIdle} also takes activity 
on pseudo-terminals into
account (i.e. virtual ``keyboard'' activity from telnet and rlogin
sessions as well).  Note that \AdAttr{KeyboardIdle} will always be equal to or
less than \AdAttr{ConsoleIdle}.
%
\item[KFlops] : Relative floating point performance as determined via a
linpack benchmark.
%
\item[LastHeardForm] : Time when the Condor Central Manager last
received a status update from this machine.  Expressed as seconds since
the epoch.
%
\item[LoadAvg] : A floating point number with the machine's current load
average.
%
\item[Machine] : A string with the machine's fully qualified hostname.
%
\item[Memory] : The amount of RAM in megabytes.
%
\item[Mips] : Relative integer performance as determined via a dhrystone
benchmark.
%
\item[MyType] : The ClassAd type; always set to the literal string ``Machine''.
%
\item[Name] : The name of this resource; typically the same value as
the \AdAttr{Machine} attribute, but could be customized by the site administrator.
%
\item[OpSys] : String describing the operating system running on this
machine.  For Condor \VersionNotice\ typically one of the following:
	\begin{description}
	\item ``HPUX10'' (for HPUX 10.20)
	\item ``IRIX6''  (for IRIX 6.2, 6.3, or 6.4)
	\item ``LINUX''  (for LINUX 2.x kernel systems)
	\item ``OSF1''	 (for Digital Unix 4.x)
	\item ``SOLARIS251''
	\item ``SOLARIS26''
	\end{description}
%
\item[Requirements] : A boolean which, when evaluated within the context
of the Machine ClassAd and a Job ClassAd, must evaluate to
TRUE before Condor will allow the job to use this machine.
%
\item[StartdIpAddr] : String with the IP and port address of the
\Condor{startd} daemon which is publishing this Machine ClassAd.
%
\item[State] : String which publishes the machine's Condor state, which
can be:
	\begin{description}
	\item[``Owner''] : The machine owner is using the machine, and
it is unavailable to Condor.
	\item[``Unclaimed''] : The machine is available to run Condor jobs,
but a good match (i.e. job to run here) is either not available or not 
yet found.
	\item[``Matched''] : The Condor Central Manager has found a good
match for this resource, but a Condor scheduler has not yet claimed it.
	\item[``Claimed''] : The machine is claimed by a remote
\Condor{schedd} and is probably running a job.
	\item[``Preempting''] : A Condor job is being preempted (possibly
via checkpointing) in order to clear the machine for either a higher
priority job or because the machine owner wants the machine back.
	\end{description}   % of State
%
\item[TargetType] : Describes what type of ClassAd to match with.
Always set to the string literal ``Job'', because Machine ClassAds
always want to be matched with Jobs, and vice-versa.
%
\item[UidDomain] : a domain name configured by the Condor 
administrator which describes a cluster of machines which all have 
the same "passwd" file entries, and therefore all have the same logins.
%
\item[VirtualMemory] : The amount of currently available virtual memory 
(wap space) expressed in kbytes.
