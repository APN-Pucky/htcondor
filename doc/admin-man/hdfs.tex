\index{Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)!integrated with Condor}

The Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) enables the efficient distribution
of potentially very large sets of data across Data-nodes.
The mapping of data locations is maintained by an HDFS Name-node.
The invocation, configuration, and use of an HDFS is integrated with Condor
\index{Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)!condor\_hdfs daemon}
through the use of the \Condor{hdfs} daemon.

The \Condor{hdfs} daemon uses the Condor configuration to generate
an HDFS XML configuration and invoke the file system. 
The file system is both deployed and maintained by Condor, 
reducing the number of separately administered systems by one.
