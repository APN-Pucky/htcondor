Flocking: Configuring a Schedd to Submit to Multiple Pools}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The \Condor{schedd} may be configured to submit jobs to more than one
pool.
In the default configuration, the \Condor{schedd} contacts the
Central Manager specified by the \Macro{CONDOR\_HOST} macro (described
in section~\ref{sec:Condor-wide-Config-File-Entries} on
page~\pageref{sec:Condor-wide-Config-File-Entries})
to locate execute machines
available to run jobs in its queue.
However, the
\Macro{FLOCK\_HOSTS} macro (described in
section~\ref{sec:Schedd-Config-File-Entries} on
page~\pageref{sec:Schedd-Config-File-Entries}) may 
be used to specify additional 
Central Managers for the \Condor{schedd} to contact.
When the local
pool does not satisfy all job requests, the \Condor{schedd} will try
the pools specified by \Macro{FLOCK\_HOSTS} in turn until all jobs are
satisfied.

\MacroUNI{HOSTALLOW\_NEGOTIATOR\_SCHEDD} (see
section~\ref{param:HostAllow}) must also be configured to allow
negotiators from all of the \MacroU{FLOCK\_HOSTS} to contact the schedd.
Please make sure the \MacroUNI{CONDOR\_HOST} is first in the 
\MacroUNI{HOSTALLOW\_NEGOTIATOR\_SCHEDD} list.
Similarly, the central managers of the remote pools must be configured
to listen to requests from this schedd.
