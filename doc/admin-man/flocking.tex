\subsection{Flocking: Configuring a Schedd to Submit to Multiple Pools}
\label{sec:Flocking}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The \Condor{schedd} may be configured to submit jobs to more than one
pool.
In the default configuration, the \Condor{schedd} contacts the
Central Manager specified by the \Macro{CONDOR\_HOST} macro (described
in section~\ref{param:CondorHost}) to locate execute machines
available to run jobs in its queue.
However, the
\Macro{FLOCK\_HOSTS} macro (described in
section~\ref{param:FlockHosts}) may be used to specify additional
Central Managers for the \Condor{schedd} to contact.
When the local
pool does not satisfy all job requests, the \Condor{schedd} will try
the pools specified by \Macro{FLOCK\_HOSTS} in turn until all jobs are
satisfied.
