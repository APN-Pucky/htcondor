\index{IPV6}

Condor has limited support for running on IPV6 networks.

Current Limitations

\begin{itemize}
    \item{Microsoft Windows is not supported.}
    \item{Mixed IPv4/IPv6 pools are not supported.}
    \item{Security policies cannot use IP addresses, only hostnames. (If you use NO\_DNS=TRUE, the "hostnames" are reformatted IP addresses, and you can match against those.)}
    \item{You must set NETWORK\_INTERFACE to a specific IPv6 address. It is not possible to use multiple IPv6 interfaces on a single computer.}
    \item{You must have valid IPv6 (AAAA) DNS and reverse DNS records for the computers. (NO\_DNS=TRUE removes this limitation.)}
\end{itemize}

Enabling IPv6

\begin{itemize}
    \item{Set ENABLE\_IPV6 = TRUE}
    \item{Specify the IPv6 interface to use. Note, do not put [square brackets] around this address.}
    \item{e.g. NETWORK\_INTERFACE = 2607:f388:1086:0:21b:24ff:fedf:b520}
\end{itemize}

Additional Notes

If you specify CONDOR\_HOST or COLLECTOR\_HOST as an IP address, you must put the address, but not the port, in square brackets. You can continue to specify hostnames. For example:

\begin{verbatim}
CONDOR_HOST =[2607:f388:1086:0:21e:68ff:fe0f]:6462
# This configures the collector to listen on the non-standard port 5332.
COLLECTOR_HOST =[2607:f388:1086:0:21e:68ff:fe0f:6462]:5332
\end{verbatim}

Because IPv6 addresses are not supported in the security settings, you will be unable to use $(CONDOR\_HOST) or $(COLLECTOR\_HOST) in your security configuration if you specify an IP address.

When using NO\_DNS, IPv6 addresses are turned into hostnames by taking the IPv6 address, changing colons to dashes, and appending DEFAULT\_DOMAIN\_NAME. 
\begin{verbatim}
So 2607:f388:1086:0:21b:24ff:fedf:b520 becomes 
2607-f388-1086-0-21b-24ff-fedf-b520.example.com 
(assuming DEFAULT_DOMAIN_NAME=example.com)
\end{verbatim}
