Pool management tasks can be enhanced by using the \Condor{startd}
daemon's ability to periodically run executables.
The executables are expected to generate ClassAd attributes as their output,
which are incorporated into the machine ClassAd.
Policy expressions may then reference the dynamic attributes.

This functionality has been referred to by several names:
the startd cron, dynamic attributes,
and a distribution of executables collectively known as Hawkeye.

All specification related to these executables is given to the
\Condor{startd} daemon by configuration.
