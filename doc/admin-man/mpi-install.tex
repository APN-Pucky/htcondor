\Notice{We have removed the MPI contrib module for this version of Condor.
It was a little too old and buggy to be useful. There is a new implementation
of the MPI contrib module currently being tested and when it is finished MPI
support will again exist in Condor. Please keep watch on this section of the
manual in future revisions for its release. Thank you.}
