The configuration variables
\Macro{HIGHPORT} and \Macro{LOWPORT} facilitate setting the range
of ports that Condor will use.
This may be useful if behind a firewall.
By default,
Condor uses port 9618 for the \Condor{collector},
9614 for the \Condor{negotiator},
and system-assigned (apparently random) ports for everything else.
\MacroNI{HIGHPORT} and \MacroNI{LOWPORT} only affect these
system-assigned ports, but will restrict them to the range specified here.

Note that both \MacroNI{HIGHPORT} and \MacroNI{LOWPORT} must be at least 1024.
