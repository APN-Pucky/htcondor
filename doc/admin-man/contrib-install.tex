\section{\label{sec:Contrib-Install}Installing Contrib Modules}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This section describes how to install various \Term{contrib modules}
in the Condor system.
Some of these modules are separate, optional pieces, not included in
the main distribution of Condor.
Examples are the checkpoint server and DAGMan.
Others are integral parts of Condor taken from the development series
that have certain features users might want to install.
Examples are the new SMP-aware \Condor{startd} and the CondorView
collector.  
Both of these things come automatically with Condor version 6.1 and
later versions.
However, if you do not want to switch over to using only the
development binaries, you can install these seperate modules
while
maintaining most of the stable release at your site.
