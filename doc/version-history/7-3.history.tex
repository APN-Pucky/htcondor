\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item Added support for CPU affinity on Linux.

\item Added support for \Condor{q}'s \Opt{-better-analyze} on Windows.

\item Added the ClassAd function \Procedure{debug}.
See section~ \ref{sec:classadFunctions} for the details of this function.

\item Log messages have been made more clear.
% Includes: Give a clear warning instead of a terse error, when lacking a COLLECTOR.

\item The \Condor{schedd} can now use MD5 checksums to avoid storing
multiple copies of the same executable in its \Macro{SPOOL} directory.
Note that this feature only affects executables sent to the
\Condor{schedd} via the \SubmitCmd{copy\_to\_spool} submit macro.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Configuration Variable Additions and Changes:

\begin{itemize}

\item The new configuration variables \Macro{ENFORCE\_CPU\_AFFINITY} and 
\Macro{SLOTx\_CPU\_AFFINITY} have been added on Linux to allow for
condor to lock slots to given CPUs.

\item The new configuration variable \Macro{DEBUG\_TIME\_FORMAT}
  allows a custom specification for the format of the time
  printed at the start of each line in a daemon's log file.
  See \ref{param:DebugTimeFormat} for the complete definition of
  this variable.

\item The new configuration variable \Macro{SHARE\_SPOOLED\_EXECUTABLES}
  is a boolean value that determines whether the \Condor{schedd} will
  use MD5 checksums to avoid storing multiple copies of the same
  executable in the \Macro{SPOOL} directory. The default setting is
  \Expr{True}.
