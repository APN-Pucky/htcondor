\subsection*{\label{sec:New-8-8-0}Version 8.8.0}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item HTCondor version 8.8.0 not yet released.
%\item HTCondor version 8.8.0 released on Month Date, 2018.

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item Made the Python bindings' \PyBindNI{JobEvent} API more Pythonic by
handling optional event attributes as if the \PyBindNI{JobEvent} object
were a dictionary, instead.  See section \ref{Python-JobEventLog} for details.
\Ticket{6820}

\item Added job ad attribute \Macro{BlockReadKbytes} and \Macro{BlockWriteKybtes}
which describe the number of kbytes read and written by the job to the sandbox
directory.  These are only defined on Linux machines with cgroup support enabled
for vanilla jobs.
\Ticket{6826}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item Jobs in REMOVED status now properly leave the queue when
evaluation of their \Attr{LeaveJobInQueue} attribute changes from
\Expr{True} to \Expr{False}.
\Ticket{6808}

\item Fixed a bug where invoking the Python bindings as root could change
the effective uid of the calling process.
\Ticket{6817}

\item Fixed a bug that could result in crashing of the \Condor{schedd} while
tring to materialize a job that has multi-column itemdata. The bug was introduced in
the 8.7.10 release.
\Ticket{6827}

\end{itemize}
