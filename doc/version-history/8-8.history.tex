\section{Stable Release Series 8.8}\label{sec:History-8-8}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This is the stable release series of HTCondor.
As usual, only bug fixes (and potentially, ports to new platforms)
will be provided in future 8.8.x releases.
New features will be added in the 8.9.x development series.

The details of each version are described below.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-8-8-1}Version 8.8.1}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item HTCondor version 8.8.1 not yet released.
%\item HTCondor version 8.8.1 released on Month Date, 2018.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Known Issues:

\begin{itemize}

\item GPU resource monitoring is no longer enabled by default after we
received reports indicating excessive CPU usage.  We believe we've fixed
the problem, but would like to get updated reports from users who were
previously affected.  To enable (the patched) GPU resource monitoring,
add `use feature: GPUsMonitor' to the HTCondor configuration.  Thank you.

\Ticket{6857}

\item Discovered a bug in DAGMan where graph metrics reporting could sometimes 
send the \condor{dagman} process into an infinite loop. We worked around this 
by disabling graph metrics reporting by default, via the new  
\Macro{DAGMAN\_REPORT\_GRAPH\_METRICS} configuration knob.
\Ticket{6896}

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item Fixed bug that prevented HTCondor on Windows from running jobs in the
default configuration when started as a service.
\Ticket{6853}

\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-8-8-0}Version 8.8.0}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item HTCondor version 8.8.0 released on January 3, 2019.

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item Provides a new package: \Expr{minicondor} on Red Hat based systems and
\Expr{minihtcondor} on Debian and Ubuntu based systems.
This mini-HTCondor package configures HTCondor to work on a single machine.
\Ticket{6823}

\item Made the Python bindings' \PyBindNI{JobEvent} API more Pythonic by
handling optional event attributes as if the \PyBindNI{JobEvent} object
were a dictionary, instead.  See section \ref{Python-JobEventLog} for details.
\Ticket{6820}

\item Added job ad attribute \MacroNI{BlockReadKbytes} and \MacroNI{BlockWriteKybtes}
which describe the number of kbytes read and written by the job to the sandbox
directory.  These are only defined on Linux machines with cgroup support enabled
for vanilla jobs.
\Ticket{6826}

\item The new \Attr{IOWait} attribute gives the I/O Wait time recorded by the
cgroup controller.
\Ticket{6830}

\item \Condor{ssh\_to\_job} is now configured to be more secure. In particular,
it will only use FIPS 140-2 approved algorithms.
\Ticket{6822}

\item Added configuration parameter \MacroNI{CRED\_SUPER\_USERS},
a list of users who are permitted to store credentials for any user
when using the \Condor{store\_credd} command. Normally, users can
only store credentials for themselves.
\Ticket{6346}

\item For packaged HTCondor installations, the package version is now present
in the HTCondor version string.
\Ticket{6828}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item Fixed a problem where a daemon would queue updates indefinitely when another
daemon is offline.
This is most noticeable as excess memory utilization when a \Condor{schedd} is
trying to flock to an offline HTCondor pool.
\Ticket{6837}

\item Fixed a bug where invoking the Python bindings as root could change
the effective uid of the calling process.
\Ticket{6817}

\item Jobs in REMOVED status now properly leave the queue when
evaluation of their \Attr{LeaveJobInQueue} attribute changes from
\Expr{True} to \Expr{False}.
\Ticket{6808}

\item Fixed a rarely occurring bug where the \Condor{schedd} would crash when
jobs were submitted with a \Expr{queue} statement with multiple keys.
The bug was introduced in the 8.7.10 release.
\Ticket{6827}

\item Fixed a couple of bugs in the job event log reader code that were made visible by
the new JobEventLog python object. The remote error and job terminated event did not read
all of the available information from the job log correctly. 
\Ticket{6816}
\Ticket{6836}

\item On Debian and Ubuntu systems, the templates for \Condor{ssh\_to\_job} and
interactive submits are no longer installed in \File{/etc/condor}.
\Ticket{6770}

\end{itemize}
