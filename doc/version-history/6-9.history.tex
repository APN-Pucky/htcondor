%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This is the development release series of Condor.
The details of each version are described below.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-6-9-1}Version 6.9.1}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}

\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item Improved the scalability of the algorithm used by 
the \Condor{schedd} daemon to find runnable jobs.
This makes a noticeable difference in \Condor{schedd} daemon performance,
when there are on the order of thousands of jobs in the queue.

\item the \Dflag{COMMAND} debugging level has been enhanced to
log many more messages. 

\item Updated the version of DRMAA, which contains several great
improvements regarding scalability and race conditions.

% Gnats PR 774
\item Added the DAGMAN\_SUBMIT\_DEPTH\_FIRST configuration macro which
causes \Condor{dagman} to submit ready nodes in more-or-less depth-first
order if set to \Expr{True}.  (The default behavior is to submit
the ready nodes in breadth-first order.)

\item Added configuration parameter \Macro{USE\_PROCESS\_GROUPS}. If it's
set to False, then Condor daemons on unix machines will not create new 
sessions or process groups. This is intended for use with Glidein, as
we've had reports that some batch systems can't properly track jobs that
create new process groups. The default value is True.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item \Condor{configure} used to always make a personal Condor with
\Opt{--install} even when \Opt{--type} called for only "execute" or
"submit" types.  Now, \Condor{configure} honors the \Opt{--type}
argument, even when using \Opt{--install}.
If \Opt{--type} is not specified, the default is to still install a
full personal Condor with the following daemons: Master, Collector,
Negotiator, Schedd, Startd. 

\end{itemize}

\noindent Known Bugs:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-6-9-0}Version 6.9.0}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item The 6.9.0 release contains all of the bug fixes and enhancements
  from the 6.8.x series up to and including version 6.8.2.

% and a few \condor{gridmanager} bug fixes from 6.8.3.  *sigh* we need
% a real solution to this problem (like pointing to issue node ids) ;)

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}


\item Preliminary support for using \Prog{glexec} on execute machines
has been added.  This feature causes the \Condor{startd} to spawn the
\Condor{starter} as the user that \Prog{glexec} determines based on
the user's GSI credential.

\item A ``per-job history files'' feature has been added to the
\Condor{schedd}. When enabled, this will cause the \Condor{schedd} to
write out a copy of each job's ClassAd when it leaves the job
queue. The directory to place these files in is determined by the
parameter \Macro{PER\_JOB\_HISTORY\_DIR}. It is the resposibilty of
whatever external entity (e.g. an accounting or monitoring system) is
using these files to remove them as it completes its processing.

\item \Condor{chirp} command now supports writing messages to the userlog.

\item \Condor{chirp} getattr and putattr now send all classad getattr
and putattr commands to the proc 0 classad, which allows multiple proc
parallel jobs to use proc 0 as a scratchpad.

\item Parallel jobs now suport an \Attr{AllRemoteHosts} attribute,
which lists all the hosts across all procs in a cluster.

\item The \Macro{DAGMAN\_ABORT\_DUPLICATES} config macro (which causes
\Condor{dagman} to abort itself if it detects another \Condor{dagman}
running on the same DAG) now defaults to \Expr{True} instead of
\Expr{False}.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.
