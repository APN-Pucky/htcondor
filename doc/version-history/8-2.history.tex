\noindent New Features:

\item The new configuration variable \Macro{SOCKET\_LISTEN\_BACKLOG}
controls the listen backlog setting for a daemon's command port.
The default value of 500 implements the previously hard coded value.
\Ticket{4393}

\item Streamlined the network protocol used by \Condor{submit},
resulting in faster job submission times and less \Condor{schedd} overhead, 
especially when performing a submit to a remote \Condor{schedd}.
\Ticket{3846}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item Windows machines with more than nine dynamic slots may have
failed to start jobs due to a limit on the number of characters
in a user name.
To address this limit, the user name is shortened from
\Expr{condor-reuse-slot<N>} to \Expr{condor-slot<N>}.
\Ticket{4388}

\item Fixed a bug in which \Condor{q} failed to communicate with a
\Condor{schedd} of HTCondor version 8.1.4.
\Ticket{4384}

\item Fixed bugs introduced in HTCondor version 8.1.5 that caused communication
between the \Prog{cream\_gahp} and the remote CREAM servers to fail.
\Ticket{4392}

\item Fixed a bug introduced in HTCondor version 8.1.2 that caused grid-type
cream jobs to fail when \SubmitCmd{copy\_to\_spool} was set to \Expr{True}
in the submit description file.
\Ticket{4391}

\item When submitting a grid universe job with a grid type of batch and
setting \SubmitCmd{request\_memory}, the job would fail if the remote
batch system was HTCondor. This has been fixed.
\Ticket{4367}

\item Fixed bug where the HTCondor central manager may attempt to
	send email to a user named NONE if \Macro{CONDOR\_DEVELOPERS}
	is left unset in the config file.
\Ticket{4399}

\end{itemize}
