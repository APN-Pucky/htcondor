\section{\label{sec:History-6-2}Stable Release Series 6.2}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This is the second stable release series of Condor.
All of the new features developed in the 6.1 series are now considered
stable, supported features of Condor.
New releases of 6.2.0 should happen infrequently and will only include
bug fixes and support for new platforms.
New features will be added and tested in the 6.3 development series. 
The details of each version are described below.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent New Features Over the 6.0 Release Series
\begin{itemize}

\item Support for running multiple jobs on SMP (Symmetric Mutli-Processor)
machines.

\end{itemize}

\noindent New Features Over the Last Development Series: 6.1.17
\begin{itemize}

\item if \Attr{CkptArch} isn't specified in the job submission file's
\Attr{Requirements} attribute, then automatically add this expression:

\begin{verbatim}
CkptRequirements = ((CkptArch == Arch) || (CkptArch =?= UNDEFINED)) &&
	((CkptOpSys == OpSys) || (CkptOpSys =?= UNDEFINED))
\end{verbatim}

to the \Attr{Requirements} expression. This allows for users who specify
a heterogeneous submission to not have to worry about having their checkpoints
incorrectly starting up on architectures for which they were not designed
to run.

\item The \Macro{APPEND\_REQ\_<universe>} config file entries now get
appended to the beginning of the expressions before Condor adds internal
default expressions.  This allows the sysadmin to override any default
policy that Condor enforces.

\item There is now a single \Macro{APPEND\_REQUIREMENTS} attribute that will get
appended to all universe's \Attr{Requirements} expressions unless a specific
\Macro{APPEND\_REQ\_STANDARD} or \Macro{APPEND\_REQ\_VANILLA} expression.

\item Increased certain networking parameters to help alleviate the 
\Condor{shadow}'s inability to contact the \Condor{schedd} during heavy load
of the system.

\item Added a \Condor{glidein} man page to the manual.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs fixed since 6.1.17
\begin{itemize}

\item On NT, the Registry would increase in size while Condor was
servicing jobs. This has been fixed.

\item Added \File{utmpx} support for Solaris 2.8 to fix a problem where
\AdAttr{KeyBoardIdle} wasn't being set correctly.

\item When doing a \Condor{hold} under NT, the job was removed instead of
held. This has been fixed.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Known Bugs:
\begin{itemize}

\item \Attr{STARTD\_HAS\_BAD\_UTMP} does not work if set to True on Solaris 
2.8.  However, since \File{utmpx} support is enabled, you shouldn't need
to do this normally.

\end{itemize}
