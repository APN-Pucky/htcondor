\section{\label{sec:History-6-2}Stable Release Series 6.2}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This is the second stable release series of Condor.
All of the new features developed in the 6.1 series are now considered
stable, supported features of Condor.
New releases of 6.2.0 should happen infrequently and will only include
bug fixes and support for new platforms.
New features will be added and tested in the 6.3 development series. 
The details of each version are described below.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{\label{sec:New-6-2-1}Version 6.2.1}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item Fixed a bug in the \Condor{startd} that would cause the daemon
to crash if you set the \Macro{POLLING\_INTERVAL} macro to a value
greater than 60.

\item In \Condor{q}, dash-arguments (e.g., -pool, -run, etc.) were being
parsed incorrectly such that the same arguments specified without a
dash would be interpreted as if the dash were present, making it
impossible to specify ``pool'' or ``globus'' or ``run'' as an owner
argument.

\item Fixed bug in \Condor{submit} that would cause certain submit
file directives to be silently ignored if you used the wrong attribute
name.  
Now, all submit file attributes can use the same names you see in the
job ClassAd (what you'd see with \begin{verbatim}condor\_q
-long\end{verbatim}).
For example, you can now use \begin{verbatim}CoreSize =
0\end{verbatim} or \begin{verbatim}core_size = 0\end{verbatim} in your 
submit file, and either one would be recognized.

\item Fixed some of the error messages in \Condor{submit} so that they
are all consistently formatted.

\item Fixed a bug in the Linux standard universe where \Cmd{calloc}{2}
would not return zero filled memory.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Known Bugs:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{\label{sec:New-6-2-0}Version 6.2.0}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent New Features Over the 6.0 Release Series
\begin{itemize}

\item Support for running multiple jobs on SMP (Symmetric Mutli-Processor)
machines.

\end{itemize}

\noindent New Features Over the Last Development Series: 6.1.17
\begin{itemize}

\item If \Attr{CkptArch} isn't specified in the job submission file's
\Attr{Requirements} attribute, then automatically add this expression:

\begin{verbatim}
CkptRequirements = ((CkptArch == Arch) || (CkptArch =?= UNDEFINED)) &&
	((CkptOpSys == OpSys) || (CkptOpSys =?= UNDEFINED))
\end{verbatim}

to the \Attr{Requirements} expression. This allows for users who specify
a heterogeneous submission to not have to worry about having their checkpoints
incorrectly starting up on architectures for which they were not designed
to run.

\item The \Macro{APPEND\_REQ\_<universe>} config file entries now get
appended to the beginning of the expressions before Condor adds internal
default expressions.  This allows the sysadmin to override any default
policy that Condor enforces.

\item There is now a single \Macro{APPEND\_REQUIREMENTS} attribute
that will get appended to all universe's \Attr{Requirements}
expressions unless a specific \Macro{APPEND\_REQ\_STANDARD} or
\Macro{APPEND\_REQ\_VANILLA} expression is defined.

\item Increased certain networking parameters to help alleviate the 
\Condor{shadow}'s inability to contact the \Condor{schedd} during heavy load
of the system.

\item Added a \Condor{glidein} man page to the manual.

\item Some of the log messages in the \Condor{startd} were modified to
be more clear and to provide more information.

\item Added a new attribute to the \Condor{startd} ClassAd when the
machine is claimed, \AdAttr{RemoteOwner}.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs fixed since 6.1.17
\begin{itemize}

\item On NT, the Registry would increase in size while Condor was
servicing jobs. This has been fixed.

\item Added \File{utmpx} support for Solaris 2.8 to fix a problem where
\AdAttr{KeyBoardIdle} wasn't being set correctly.

\item When doing a \Condor{hold} under NT, the job was removed instead of
held. This has been fixed.

\item When using the \Arg{-master} argument to\Condor{restart}, the
\Condor{master} used to exit instead of restarting.
Now, the \Condor{master} correctly restarts itself in this case.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Known Bugs:
\begin{itemize}

\item \Attr{STARTD\_HAS\_BAD\_UTMP} does not work if set to True on Solaris 
2.8.  However, since \File{utmpx} support is enabled, you shouldn't
need to do this normally.

\end{itemize}
