%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-8-3-0}Version 8.3.0}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item HTCondor version 8.3.0 not yet released.
%\item HTCondor version 8.3.0 released on Month Date, 2014.

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item The job ClassAd attribute \Attr{DAG\_Status} is included in 
the \File{dagman.out} file.
\Ticket{4381}

\item When a daemon creates a child daemon process, it also creates a
security session shared with the child daemon.
This makes the initial communication between the daemons more efficient.
\Ticket{4405}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item Fixed a bug that caused \Condor{dagman} to unnecessarily attempt
to read node job submit files, which could cause spurious warnings
in recovery mode.  (Strictly speaking, the bug is fixed only for the
default case of \MacroNI{DAGMAN\_ALWAYS\_USE\_NODE\_LOG} being set
to true.)
\Ticket{3843}

\end{itemize}
