\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item Fixed a bug that caused \Condor{dagman} to unnecessarily attempt
to read node job submit files, which could cause spurious warnings
in recovery mode.  (Strictly speaking, the bug is fixed only for the
default case of \MacroNI{DAGMAN\_ALWAYS\_USE\_NODE\_LOG} being set
to true.)
