\section{\label{sec:History-8-3}Development Release Series 8.3}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This is the development release series of HTCondor.
The details of each version are described below.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-8-3-0}Version 8.3.0}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item HTCondor version 8.3.0 released on August 12, 2014.
This release contains all improvements and bug fixes from 
HTCondor version 8.2.2.

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item When a daemon creates a child daemon process, it also creates a
security session shared with the child daemon.
This makes the initial communication between the daemons more efficient.
\Ticket{4405}

\item The synchronization of the job event log was improved by only
using \Procedure{fsync} where necessary and 
\Procedure{fdatasync} where sufficient.  
This should provide a small reduction in disk I/O to 
the \Condor{schedd} daemon.
\Ticket{4283}

\item CPU usage by the \Condor{collector} has been reduced when
handling normal queries from \Condor{status},
and CPU usage by the \Condor{schedd} has been reduced when
handling normal queries from \Condor{q}.
\Ticket{4448}

\item HTCondor can now internally cache the result of Globus authorization
callouts.  
The caching behavior is enabled by setting configuration variable
\Macro{GSS\_ASSIST\_GRIDMAP\_CACHE\_EXPIRATION} to a non-zero value.
This feature will be useful for sites that use the Globus authorization
callouts based only on DN and VOMS FQAN, and for sites that have 
performance issues.
\Ticket{4138}

\item The job ClassAd attribute \Attr{DAG\_Status} is included in 
the \File{dagman.out} file.
\Ticket{4381}

\item The new \Opt{-DoRecovery} command line option for \Condor{dagman}
and \Condor{submit\_dag} causes \Condor{dagman} to run in
recovery mode.
\Ticket{2218}

\item The new \Opt{-ads} option to \Condor{status} permits a set of ClassAds
to be read from a file, processing the ClassAds as if they came from
the \Condor{collector}.
\Ticket{4414}

\item Daemon ClassAd hooks implementing Startd Cron functionality  
can now return multiple ClassAds,
and the hooks can specify which ClassAds their output should merge into.
\Ticket{4398}

\item Two new \Condor{schedd} ClassAd statistics attributes are
available: \Attr{JobsRunning} and \Attr{JobsAccumExceptionalBadputTime}.
\Ticket{4409}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item Fixed a bug that caused \Condor{dagman} to unnecessarily attempt
to read node job submit description files, 
which could cause spurious warnings when in recovery mode.
Strictly speaking, the bug is fixed only for the
default case in which \MacroNI{DAGMAN\_ALWAYS\_USE\_NODE\_LOG} is set
to \Expr{True}.
\Ticket{3843}

\item Fixed a bug in the \Condor{schedd} daemon that caused the values
of the ClassAd attributes \Attr{JobsRunningSizes} and 
\Attr{ JobsRunningRuntimes} to be much larger than they should have been.
\Ticket{4409}

\end{itemize}
