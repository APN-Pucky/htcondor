\section{\label{sec:History-8-3}Development Release Series 8.3}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This is the development release series of HTCondor.
The details of each version are described below.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-8-3-0}Version 8.3.0}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item HTCondor version 8.3.0 not yet released.
%\item HTCondor version 8.3.0 released on Month Date, 2014.

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item The job ClassAd attribute \Attr{DAG\_Status} is included in 
the \File{dagman.out} file.
\Ticket{4381}

\item When a daemon creates a child daemon process, it also creates a
security session shared with the child daemon.
This makes the initial communication between the daemons more efficient.
\Ticket{4405}

\item Added a \Opt{-DoRecovery} command-line flag to \Condor{dagman}
and \Condor{submit\_dag} that causes \Condor{dagman} to run in
recovery mode (see ~\ref{man-condor-submit-dag}).
\Ticket{2218}

\item The synchronization of the job event log was improved by only
using \Procedure{fsync} where necessary and 
\Procedure{fdatasync} where sufficient.  
This should provide a small reduction in disk I/O to 
the \Condor{schedd} daemon.
\Ticket{4283}

\item HTCondor can now internally cache the result of Globus authorization
callouts.  The caching behavior can be enabled by setting
\Macro{GSS\_ASSIST\_GRIDMAP\_CACHE\_EXPIRATION} to a non-zero value (default
is zero) in seconds.  This will be useful for sites that use the Globus authorization
callouts based only on DN and VOMS FQAN and have performance issues.
\Ticket{4138}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item Fixed a bug that caused \Condor{dagman} to unnecessarily attempt
to read node job submit description files, 
which could cause spurious warnings when in recovery mode.
Strictly speaking, the bug is fixed only for the
default case in which \MacroNI{DAGMAN\_ALWAYS\_USE\_NODE\_LOG} is set
to \Expr{True}.
\Ticket{3843}

\end{itemize}
