\section{\label{sec:History-8-3}Development Release Series 8.3}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This is the development release series of HTCondor.
The details of each version are described below.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-8-3-1}Version 8.3.1}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item HTCondor version 8.3.1 not yet released.
%\item HTCondor version 8.3.1 released on Month Date, 2014.

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item If cgroups are enabled on Linux platforms, 
the amount of swap space used by a job is now limited to the 
size specified by the machine ClassAd attribute \Attr{VirtualMemory} 
for the slot that the job is running on.
\Ticket{4417}

\item The new configuration variable \Macro{COLLECTOR\_PORT} specifies
the default port used by the \Condor{collector} daemon and command line tools.
The default value is 9618.
This default is the same port as has been used in previous HTCondor versions.
\Ticket{4432}

\item The \Condor{shared\_port} daemon is now enabled by default 
for new installations on non-Windows platforms.
With this change, 
all HTCondor daemons will share port 9618 for all incoming TCP connections,
greatly simplifying firewall configuration.  
Only users of HTCondor-G submitting to Globus GRAM endpoints 
will need additional incoming TCP ports in the firewall.

Note that this causes \emph{all} HTCondor hosts to use 
TCP port 9618 by default,
differing from previous behavior.
Previously, only the \Condor{collector} host used a fixed port.
To restore the previous behavior, 
set the new configuration variable \Macro{SHARED\_PORT\_PORT} to \Expr{0}.
\Ticket{3813}

\item The \Condor{shared\_port} daemon will now work 
if the value of configuration variable \Macro{DAEMON\_SOCKET\_DIR} is
longer than 100 characters in length.
\Ticket{4465}

\item Improvements to CCB increase performance.
\Ticket{4453}

\item The use of a single log file to write events and enforce the 
dependencies of a DAG represented by a \Condor{dagman} instance is mandatory.
To implement this,
the \Opt{-dont\_use\_default\_node\_log} command-line
option to \Condor{submit\_dag} is disabled,
and an attempt to set configuration variable
\Macro{DAGMAN\_ALWAYS\_USE\_NODE\_LOG} to \Expr{False} will generate an
error.
\Ticket{3994}

\item The new \Condor{dagman} configuration macro
\Macro{DAGMAN\_SUPPRESS\_JOB\_LOGS} allows users to prevent DAG node
jobs from writing to the log file specified in their submit file.
\Ticket{4353}

\item Added optional \Expr{@(OWNER)} and \Expr{@(NODE\_NAME)} macros
to the \Macro{DAGMAN\_DEFAULT\_NODE\_LOG} configuration macro.
This makes it easier to avoid log file collisions.
\Ticket{4334}

\item \Condor{submit} will no longer insert an \Attr{OpSys} requirement
for a job
when one of \Attr{OpSysAndVer}, \Attr{OpSysLongName}, \Attr{OpSysName},
or \Attr{OpSysShortName} is already specified by the user in
the \Attr{Requirements} expression of the submit description file.
\Ticket{4519}

\item The user-specific global configuration file \Expr{~/.condor/condor\_config} has
been removed, and a user-specific override configuration file has been added.
The user-specific override configuration file defaults to \Expr{~/.condor/user\_config}.
If it exists it is parsed after all of the other configuration files and before the
environment overrides are parsed.
The new configuration parameter \Macro{USER\_CONFIG\_FILE} can be used to change the
default filename or to disable this feature.
This feature now works on Windows as well as Unix and Linux.
\Ticket{3158}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-8-3-0}Version 8.3.0}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item HTCondor version 8.3.0 released on August 12, 2014.
This release contains all improvements and bug fixes from 
HTCondor version 8.2.2.

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item When a daemon creates a child daemon process, it also creates a
security session shared with the child daemon.
This makes the initial communication between the daemons more efficient.
\Ticket{4405}

\item Negotiation cycle performance has been improved, especially
over a wide-area network, by reducing network traffic and latency
between a submit machine and a central manager.
The new configuration variable 
\Macro{NEGOTIATOR\_RESOURCE\_REQUEST\_LIST\_SIZE}
does performance tuning, as defined 
in section~\ref{param:NegotiatorResourceRequestListSize}.
\Ticket{4460}

\item The synchronization of the job event log was improved by only
using \Procedure{fsync} where necessary and 
\Procedure{fdatasync} where sufficient.  
This should provide a small reduction in disk I/O to 
the \Condor{schedd} daemon.
\Ticket{4283}

\item CPU usage by the \Condor{collector} has been reduced when
handling normal queries from \Condor{status},
and CPU usage by the \Condor{schedd} has been reduced when
handling normal queries from \Condor{q}.
\Ticket{4448}

\item HTCondor can now internally cache the result of Globus authorization
callouts.  
The caching behavior is enabled by setting configuration variable
\Macro{GSS\_ASSIST\_GRIDMAP\_CACHE\_EXPIRATION} to a non-zero value.
This feature will be useful for sites that use the Globus authorization
callouts based only on DN and VOMS FQAN, and for sites that have 
performance issues.
\Ticket{4138}

\item The job ClassAd attribute \Attr{DAG\_Status} is included in 
the \File{dagman.out} file.
\Ticket{4381}

\item The new \Opt{-DoRecovery} command line option for \Condor{dagman}
and \Condor{submit\_dag} causes \Condor{dagman} to run in
recovery mode.
\Ticket{2218}

\item The new \Opt{-ads} option to \Condor{status} permits a set of ClassAds
to be read from a file, processing the ClassAds as if they came from
the \Condor{collector}.
\Ticket{4414}

\item Daemon ClassAd hooks implementing Startd Cron functionality  
can now return multiple ClassAds,
and the hooks can specify which ClassAds their output should merge into.
\Ticket{4398}

\item Two new \Condor{schedd} ClassAd statistics attributes are
available: \Attr{JobsRunning} and \Attr{JobsAccumExceptionalBadputTime}.
\Ticket{4409}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item Fixed a bug that caused \Condor{dagman} to unnecessarily attempt
to read node job submit description files, 
which could cause spurious warnings when in recovery mode.
Strictly speaking, the bug is fixed only for the
default case in which \MacroNI{DAGMAN\_ALWAYS\_USE\_NODE\_LOG} is set
to \Expr{True}.
\Ticket{3843}

\item Fixed a bug in the \Condor{schedd} daemon that caused the values
of the ClassAd attributes \Attr{JobsRunningSizes} and 
\Attr{ JobsRunningRuntimes} to be much larger than they should have been.
\Ticket{4409}

\end{itemize}
