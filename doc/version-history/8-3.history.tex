\section{\label{sec:History-8-3}Development Release Series 8.3}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This is the development release series of HTCondor.
The details of each version are described below.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-8-3-4}Version 8.3.4}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item HTCondor version 8.3.4 not yet released.
%\item HTCondor version 8.3.4 released on Month Date, 2014.

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item HTCondor now sets OMP\_NUM\_THREADS in the job's environment
to the number of cores of the slot it is running in. This prevents
OpenMP-linked jobs (including matlab) from attempting to use
more cores than they have been provisioned.
\Ticket{4884}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item Fixed a bug where a collector would be unable to update its own ad
in some situatons.
\Ticket{4850}

\item Fixed a bug introduced in HTCondor 8.3.2 that caused the -absent
option of \Condor{status} to print duplicated information about each
ad.
\Ticket{4853}

\item The python bindings now accept ClassAd expressions for the constraint
of a Schedd or a Collector query, matching the behavior documented in the manual.
\Ticket{4907}

\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-8-3-3}Version 8.3.3}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item HTCondor version 8.3.3 released on Feb. 19, 2015.

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item Configuration variable \Macro{ENCRYPT\_EXECUTE\_DIRECTORY} 
is now honored on Linux platforms.
The Linux platform must have the  \Prog{ecryptfs-utils} package installed
and the Linux kernel must be version 2.6.29 or a more recent version.
The new submit command \SubmitCmd{encrypt\_execute\_directory} allows the user
to specify directory encryption on a per-job basis.
\Ticket{4856}


\item By default, HTCondor will no longer have access to Linux 
	system credentials, such as OpenAFS tokens or eCryptFS keys.
	This new behavior ensures these credentials cannot be
	unintentionally obtained by user jobs.  
	For more information, see new configuration variable 
	\Macro{DISCARD\_SESSION\_KEYRING\_ON\_STARTUP}
	in section~\ref{param:DiscardSessionKeyringOnStartup}.
\Ticket{4856}

\item \Condor{q} now offers the new command line option \Arg{-autocluster}, 
which causes it to output \Condor{schedd} daemon auto cluster information. 
The information is an ID number and the number of jobs in each auto cluster.
\Ticket{4792}

\item EC2 grid universe jobs may now specify an IAM (instance) profile.
\Ticket{4810}

\item EC2 jobs may now specify security group IDs instead of names.
This allows the use of VPC instances with non-default security groups.
\Ticket{4796}

\item EC2 jobs may now specify additional parameters to use when starting
the corresponding instance.
\Ticket{4795}

\item Improved the preliminary support for IPv4 and IPv6 dual-protocol
submit nodes,
by allowing them to work with the \Condor{shared\_port} daemon.
\Ticket{4712}

\item The throughput of queries to the \Condor{collector} has been
improved, as the \Condor{collector} now never forks to handle queries 
about \Condor{collector}, \Condor{negotiator}, and \Condor{schedd}
ClassAds.
\Ticket{4821}

\item The new configuration variable \Macro{ADD\_SIGNIFICANT\_ATTRIBUTES}
lists job attributes to be added to the \Condor{negotiator}-determined list
when considering auto clustering.
The new configuration variable \Macro{REMOVE\_SIGNIFICANT\_ATTRIBUTES}
lists job attributes to be removed from the \Condor{negotiator}-determined 
list when considering auto clustering.
\Ticket{4797}

\item For all tools that support the \Opt{-format} or \Opt{-autoformat} option,
the new \%r conversion specifier causes values to be displayed 
in their unevaluated, or raw form.
\Ticket{4814}

\item \Condor{dagman} now prints the hold reason to the \File{dagman.out}
file when node jobs go on hold.
\Ticket{4766}

\item New python bindings can be used to query and set the 
configuration variables of running daemons.
\Ticket{4778}

\item Python functions can be invoked directly from ClassAd expressions 
within HTCondor daemons.  
A system administrator must set the new configuration variable
\Macro{CLASSAD\_USER\_PYTHON\_MODULES}
to specify the python modules that are accessible from within ClassAds.
\Ticket{4773}

\item The new Python \texttt{LogReader} class permits the reading and access
of individual daemon log events.
\Ticket{4588}

\item The default value for configuration variable 
\Macro{DAGMAN\_MAX\_JOBS\_IDLE} has changed from 0, 
which imposes no limits, to 1000.
\Ticket{4748}

\item Configuration variable \Macro{DAGMAN\_USE\_OLD\_DAG\_READER}
is no longer supported.  
Setting it to \Expr{True} will result in a warning, 
and the setting will have no effect on how a DAG input file is read.
\Ticket{4186}

\item ClassAd attributes written by the \Condor{schedd} that
count the number of jobs in various states now include all jobs, 
not only jobs that need to be matched by the \Condor{negotiator} daemon.
These attributes include \Attr{TotalRunningJobs}, \Attr{TotalIdleJobs},
\Attr{TotalHeldJobs}, and \Attr{TotalRemovedJobs}.
\Ticket{4683}

\item \Condor{q} and \Condor{history} offer the new command line option 
\Opt{-limit}, 
which limits number of results returned.
\Ticket{4806}

\item A new, more efficient query protocol has been added as the default 
for \Condor{q},
when querying a \Condor{schedd} daemon that is version 8.3.3 or later. 
To disable this new protocol, set configuration variable
\Macro{CONDOR\_Q\_USE\_V3\_PROTOCOL} to \Expr{False}.
\Ticket{4828}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item Fixed a bug that prevented CCB servers from running on Windows platforms.
\Ticket{4713}

\item Configuration variables \MacroNI{ENABLE\_IPV4} or 
\MacroNI{ENABLE\_IPV6} may now be safely set in any configuration file. 
Previously, setting them in any file other than the first configuration file 
parsed could have led to unpredictable behavior.
\Ticket{4829}

\item Fixed a bug in the \Condor{startd} daemon introduced in HTCondor 
version 8.3.2.
The \Condor{startd} slots could get stuck
forever in the Preempting/Killing state when they were claimed by 
an HTCondor version 8.3.1 or older \Condor{schedd}.
\Ticket{4807}

\item Fixed an issue introduced in HTCondor version 8.3.0
that could cause the \Condor{schedd} to become unresponsive when a client 
set configuration variable \Macro{CONDOR\_Q\_USE\_V3\_PROTOCOL} 
to its non default value of \Expr{True}.
\Ticket{4805}

\item Configuration variable \Macro{GRACEFULLY\_REMOVE\_JOBS} now
controls how a running job is killed for all cases,
including when a job policy expression causes the job to be held or removed.
Previously, this configuration variable was consulted only 
when the user ran \Condor{hold} or \Condor{rm}.
\Ticket{4679}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Known Bugs:

\begin{itemize}

\item The ability to transparently encrypt execute directories
is not supported by execute hosts using RHEL 7 and derivative distributions,
as these distributions no longer contain the \Prog{eCryptfs} kernel module.

\item  The submit commands 
\SubmitCmd{on\_exit\_hold} and \SubmitCmd{on\_exit\_remove}  
do not do what they are supposed to do
for local universe jobs on Windows machines.
\Ticket{4902}
\end{itemize}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-8-3-2}Version 8.3.2}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item HTCondor version 8.3.2 released on December 23, 2014.
This version contains all bug fixes from HTCondor version 8.2.6.

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item It is now possible run a dual-protocol (IPv4 and IPv6) submit node,
submitting to single-protocol execute nodes. This is preliminary work.
\Ticket{4494}

\item The port used by the \Condor{shared\_port} daemon is now
9618 by default.
\Ticket{3813}

\item Improved the handling when vm universe jobs failure to start.
Failures which do
not appear to be the fault of the job now cause the job to be rescheduled and
the machine stops advertising the ability to run vm universe jobs.
The new \Condor{condor\_update\_machine\_ad} tool facilitates changing
the machine ClassAd.
\Ticket{4375}

\item The memory footprint of the \Condor{shadow} has been
reduced when \Prog{Kerberos} or SSL authentication methods are not used, 
as these libraries are now loaded on demand at run time.
\Ticket{374} 

\item The responsiveness of a busy \Condor{schedd} daemon to queries
has been improved.
\Ticket{4735} 
\Ticket{4594} 

\item Added the ability to specify the block device mapping for EC2 jobs.
\Ticket{4657}

\item The new python binding \Procedure{register} has been added 
to allow python functions
be registered with the ClassAds library.  This allows python
functions to be invoked from within ClassAds.
\Ticket{4598}

\item The new python bindings \Procedure{externalRefs} and 
\Procedure{internalRefs} have been added to allow the ClassAd object
to determine internal and external references from an expression.
\Ticket{4681}

\item When the \Condor{startd} has a live \Condor{starter}, 
claim keep alives are sent
by the existing TCP connection between the \Condor{starter} and \Condor{schedd},
rather than creating a new connection to the 
\Condor{schedd} from the \Condor{startd}.
\Ticket{4491}

\item Added the DAGMan feature of \Arg{ALWAYS-UPDATE} for updates
of a DAGMan node status file. 
Specifying this causes the node status file to be overwritten,
even if no nodes have changed status since the file was last written.
\Ticket{4607}

\item Configuration variable \Macro{MAX\_JOBS\_RUNNING} has been
modified such that it only applies to job universes that require a
\Condor{shadow} process.
Scheduler and local universe jobs are no longer affected by this
variable.
The number of running scheduler and local universe jobs can be controlled
with configuration variables \MacroNI{START\_SCHEDULER\_UNIVERSE} and
\MacroNI{START\_LOCAL\_UNIVERSE}, respectively.
\Ticket{4589}

\item The specific versions of Globus GSI libraries to be loaded at run time
are determined at compile time. 
\Ticket{4585} 

\item HTCondor now sets environment variable \Env{\_CONDOR\_JOB\_AD} for
scheduler universe jobs. 
Its value will be the path to a file which contains
the job ClassAd as it was when the job was started.
This feature already exists for vanilla, parallel, java, and local
universe jobs.
\Ticket{4558}

\item The new \Opt{-debug} option to \Condor{userprio} sends
debug output to \File{stderr}.
\Ticket{4636}

\item HTCondor daemons now support a whitelist of statistics attributes to
publish from their ClassAd to the \Condor{collector}.  
This is intended to ease
configuration on systems that use \Prog{ganglia} for monitoring.
\Ticket{4645}

\item New statistics have been added to the \Condor{schedd} to monitor runtime
spent doing DNS queries, using \Prog{fsync}, 
and rebuilding the priority list for negotiation.  
Also additional attributes for average, maximum and minimum
have been added to runtime statistics for command handlers 
for all HTCondor daemons.
These changes are intended to help direct future scalability work.
\Ticket{4593}
\Ticket{4595}

\item The new daemon logging level, \Dflag{SUB\_SECOND}, 
enables millisecond resolution timestamps in daemon logs.
\Ticket{4660}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item Fixed a bug introduced in HTCondor version 8.3.1 that caused daemons to be
unreachable if they were configured to use the \Condor{shared\_port} daemon,
but the \Condor{master} was not.
\Ticket{4603}

\item Updated the CREAM client library used in the \Prog{cream\_gahp}.
This fixes the delegation of RFC format proxies, in addition to other
bug fixes.
\Ticket{4596}

\item Fixed a bug that could cause a segmentation fault of \Condor{dagman}
for some DAG input file syntax errors,
rather than printing an appropriate error message.
\Ticket{4616}

\item Fixed a bug that could cause the \Condor{shared\_port} daemon
to fail on Mac OS X platforms,
if configuration variable \MacroNI{LOCK} was not explicitly set 
in a configuration file.
\Ticket{4678}

\item Fixed a bug that caused both \Condor{dagman} and the \Condor{schedd}
daemon to generate commands to remove \Condor{dagman}'s node jobs when
the \Condor{dagman} job is the target of \Condor{rm}.
Now, only the \Condor{schedd} generates the command, 
avoiding the extra load of running two identical commands.
\Ticket{4618}

\item Fixed a bug that caused the DAGMan node status file,
as detailed in section~\ref{sec:DAG-node-status},
to not reflect the final status of a DAG when the DAG is removed
by issuing a \Condor{rm} command,
or when the DAG is
aborted due to an ABORT-DAG-ON specification in the DAG input file.
\Ticket{4686}

\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-8-3-1}Version 8.3.1}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item HTCondor version 8.3.1 released on September 11, 2014.

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item If cgroups are enabled on Linux platforms, 
the amount of swap space used by a job is now limited to the 
size specified by the machine ClassAd attribute \Attr{VirtualMemory} 
for the slot that the job is running on.
\Ticket{4417}

\item The new configuration variable \Macro{COLLECTOR\_PORT} specifies
the default port used by the \Condor{collector} daemon and command line tools.
The default value is 9618.
This default is the same port as has been used in previous HTCondor versions.
\Ticket{4432}

\item The \Condor{shared\_port} daemon will now work 
if the default location given by configuration variable
\Macro{DAEMON\_SOCKET\_DIR}, which is \Expr{\$(LOCK)/daemon\_sock},
is longer than 90 characters in length.
On Linux platforms, abstract sockets are now the primary method for
\Condor{shared\_port} to forward an incoming connection to the intended
daemon.
\Ticket{4465}

\item Improvements to CCB increase performance.
\Ticket{4453}

\item The use of a single log file to write events and enforce the 
dependencies of a DAG represented by a \Condor{dagman} instance is mandatory.
To implement this,
the \Opt{-dont\_use\_default\_node\_log} command-line
option to \Condor{submit\_dag} is disabled,
and an attempt to set configuration variable
\Macro{DAGMAN\_ALWAYS\_USE\_NODE\_LOG} to \Expr{False} will generate an
error.
\Ticket{3994}

\item The new \Condor{dagman} configuration variable
\Macro{DAGMAN\_SUPPRESS\_JOB\_LOGS} allows users to prevent DAG node
jobs from writing to the log file specified in their submit description file.
See section~\ref{param:DAGManSuppressJobLogs} for details.
\Ticket{4353}

\item New special variables \Expr{@(OWNER)} and \Expr{@(NODE\_NAME)} are
available when defining configuration variable
\Macro{DAGMAN\_DEFAULT\_NODE\_LOG}.
These values make it easier to avoid log file name collisions.
\Ticket{4334}

\item \Condor{submit} will no longer insert an \Attr{OpSys} requirement
for a job
when one of \Attr{OpSysAndVer}, \Attr{OpSysLongName}, \Attr{OpSysName},
or \Attr{OpSysShortName} is already specified by the user in
the \Attr{Requirements} expression of the submit description file.
\Ticket{4519}

\item The configuration file \Expr{\$(HOME)/.condor/condor\_config}
is no longer considered for the single, initial, global configuration file.
Instead, a user-specific configuration file has been added as the
last file parsed.
The new configuration variable \Macro{USER\_CONFIG\_FILE} may change the
default file name or disable this feature.
Section~\ref{sec:Ordering-Config-File} describes the ordering
in which configuration files are parsed.
\Ticket{3158}

\item Daemons now authenticate many client network connections in
parallel, rather than one at a time.
This improves the scalability of daemons that receive many client
connections, like the \Condor{schedd} and \Condor{collector}.
The improvement is most noticeable when using the FS and GSI
authentication methods.
\Ticket{4137}

\item The GSI security libraries are now loaded into memory only when GSI
authentication is required.
This reduces memory usage when GSI authentication is not used.
The memory reduction will be most noticeable when there are many
\Condor{shadow} processes running.
\Ticket{4483}

\item Implemented fine-grained locking in the HTCondor python module to
allow other python threads to run during HTCondor calls.
\Ticket{4507}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-8-3-0}Version 8.3.0}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item HTCondor version 8.3.0 released on August 12, 2014.
This release contains all improvements and bug fixes from 
HTCondor version 8.2.2.

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item When a daemon creates a child daemon process, it also creates a
security session shared with the child daemon.
This makes the initial communication between the daemons more efficient.
\Ticket{4405}

\item Negotiation cycle performance has been improved, especially
over a wide-area network, by reducing network traffic and latency
between a submit machine and a central manager.
The new configuration variable 
\Macro{NEGOTIATOR\_RESOURCE\_REQUEST\_LIST\_SIZE}
does performance tuning, as defined 
in section~\ref{param:NegotiatorResourceRequestListSize}.
\Ticket{4460}

\item The synchronization of the job event log was improved by only
using \Procedure{fsync} where necessary and 
\Procedure{fdatasync} where sufficient.  
This should provide a small reduction in disk I/O to 
the \Condor{schedd} daemon.
\Ticket{4283}

\item CPU usage by the \Condor{collector} has been reduced when
handling normal queries from \Condor{status},
and CPU usage by the \Condor{schedd} has been reduced when
handling normal queries from \Condor{q}.
\Ticket{4448}

\item HTCondor can now internally cache the result of Globus authorization
callouts.  
The caching behavior is enabled by setting configuration variable
\Macro{GSS\_ASSIST\_GRIDMAP\_CACHE\_EXPIRATION} to a non-zero value.
This feature will be useful for sites that use the Globus authorization
callouts based only on DN and VOMS FQAN, and for sites that have 
performance issues.
\Ticket{4138}

\item The job ClassAd attribute \Attr{DAG\_Status} is included in 
the \File{dagman.out} file.
\Ticket{4381}

\item The new \Opt{-DoRecovery} command line option for \Condor{dagman}
and \Condor{submit\_dag} causes \Condor{dagman} to run in
recovery mode.
\Ticket{2218}

\item The new \Opt{-ads} option to \Condor{status} permits a set of ClassAds
to be read from a file, processing the ClassAds as if they came from
the \Condor{collector}.
\Ticket{4414}

\item Daemon ClassAd hooks implementing Startd Cron functionality  
can now return multiple ClassAds,
and the hooks can specify which ClassAds their output should merge into.
\Ticket{4398}

\item Two new \Condor{schedd} ClassAd statistics attributes are
available: \Attr{JobsRunning} and \Attr{JobsAccumExceptionalBadputTime}.
\Ticket{4409}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item Fixed a bug that caused \Condor{dagman} to unnecessarily attempt
to read node job submit description files, 
which could cause spurious warnings when in recovery mode.
Strictly speaking, the bug is fixed only for the
default case in which \MacroNI{DAGMAN\_ALWAYS\_USE\_NODE\_LOG} is set
to \Expr{True}.
\Ticket{3843}

\item Fixed a bug in the \Condor{schedd} daemon that caused the values
of the ClassAd attributes \Attr{JobsRunningSizes} and 
\Attr{ JobsRunningRuntimes} to be much larger than they should have been.
\Ticket{4409}

\end{itemize}
