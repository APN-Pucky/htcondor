\index{upgrading!items to be aware of}
Upgrading from the 8.4 series of HTCondor to the 8.6 series
will bring new features introduced in the 8.5 series of HTCondor.
These new features include:
\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}

Upgrading from the 8.4 series of HTCondor to the 8.6 series will
also introduce changes that administrators and users of sites running from an older
HTCondor version should be aware of when planning an upgrade.
Here is a list of items that administrators should be aware of.

\begin{itemize}

\item Shared port is now enabled by default.  Set \MacroNI{USE\_SHARED\_PORT}
to false to disable.  This configuration macro does not control the HAD or
replication daemon's use of shared port; use \MacroNI{HAD\_USE\_SHARED\_PORT}
or \MacroNI{REPLICATION\_USE\_SHARED\_PORT} instead.  See
\ref{sec:HA-configuration} for more details on how to configure HAD (and/or
the replication daemon) to work with shared port, since just activating
shared port without any other configuration change will not work.

\item To mitigate performance problems, \MacroNI{LOWPORT} and
\MacroNI{HIGHPORT} no longer restrict outbound port ranges on Windows.  To
re-enable this functionality, set \MacroNI{OUT\_LOWPORT} and
\MacroNI{OUT\_HIGHPORT}.  (\Ticket{4711})

\item By default, \Condor{q} queries only the current user's jobs,
unless the current user is a queue superuser or the
\MacroNI{CONDOR\_Q\_ONLY\_MY\_JOBS} configuration macro is set to
\Expr{False}.

% \item By default, \Condor{q} is now invoked with the \Opt{-batch}
% option, which displays a single line for each batch of jobs,
% rather than one line per job.

\end{itemize}
