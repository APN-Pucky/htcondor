\index{upgrading!items to be aware of}
Upgrading from the 8.4 series of HTCondor to the 8.6 series
will bring new features introduced in the 8.5 series of HTCondor.
These new features include:
\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}

Upgrading from the 8.4 series of HTCondor to the 8.6 series will
also introduce changes that administrators and users of sites running from an older
HTCondor version should be aware of when planning an upgrade.
Here is a list of items that administrators should be aware of.

\begin{itemize}

\item Shared port is now enabled by default.

\item As a result, if you are currently using HAD, you must adjust your
configuration.  See \ref{sec:HA-configuration} for more details and how
to configure HAD (with or without replication) to work with shared port.
Usually, \MacroNI{REPLICATION\_SOCKET\_NAME} will need to be
unset (set to blank) and \MacroNI{HAD.USE\_SHARED\_PORT} and
\MacroNI{REPLICATION.USE\_SHARED\_PORT} each set to false.

\item To mitigate performance problems, \MacroNI{LOWPORT} and
\MacroNI{HIGHPORT} no longer restrict outbound port ranges on Windows.  To
re-enable this functionality, set \MacroNI{OUT\_LOWPORT} and
\MacroNI{OUT\_HIGHPORT}.  (\Ticket{4711})

\item By default, \Condor{q} queries only the current user's jobs,
unless the current user is a queue superuser or the
MacroNI{CONDOR\_Q\_ONLY\_MY\_JOBS} configuration macro is set to
\Expr{False}.

% \item By default, \Condor{q} is now invoked with the \Opt{-batch}
% option, which displays a single line for each batch of jobs,
% rather than one line per job.

\end{itemize}
