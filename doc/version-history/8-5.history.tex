\section{\label{sec:History-8-5}Development Release Series 8.5}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This is the development release series of HTCondor.
The details of each version are described below.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-8-5-1}Version 8.5.1}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item HTCondor version 8.5.1 not yet released.
%\item HTCondor version 8.5.1 released on Month Date, 2015.

\item Shared port is enabled by default.

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item When the \Condor{starter} evicts a job, perhaps because
it has exceeded a memory limit, it does not transfer back to
the submit machine the sandbox of working files.  This is
consistent with other types of holds.
\Ticket{5437}

\item The \Condor{startd} history file now contains two
new attributes, BadputCausedByDraining and BadputCausedByPreemption
which are boolean valued attributes which are true if the job
was preempted before completion, either because of draining or 
preemption, respectively.
\Ticket{5255}

\item The \Condor{startd} history file now contains the peak
memory usage, by an exited job, not the more recent.
\Ticket{5436}

\item The \Condor{startd} now advertises the following attributes
on Linux machines: CpuFamily CpuModelNumber CacheSize.  These are
pulled from the /proc/cpuinfo file.
\Ticket{5323}

\item When an HTCondor-C job is submitted to a remote \Condor{schedd},
the remote job ad now includes the attribute \AdAttr{SubmitterGlobalJobId},
whose value is the same as the attribute \AdAttr{GlobalJobId} in the
original HTCondor-C job.
\Ticket{3472}

\item The \Condor{schedd} now sets environment variables for scheduler
universe jobs so that the jobs can more easily find the \Condor{schedd}'s
contact information.
On machines where there are multiple \Condor{schedd}s running, this helps
DAGMan and similar applications contact the \Condor{schedd} that started
them.
\Ticket{5166}

\item When \MacroNI{SEC\_ENABLE\_MATCH\_PASSWORD\_AUTHENTICATION} is set
to \Expr{True}, the related authorizations are now automatically enabled.
Previously, \Expr{submit-side@matchsession} and
\Expr{execute-side@matchsession} entries had to be added to the
\MacroNI{ALLOW\_DAEMON} and \MacroNI{ALLOW\_CLIENT} (if set)
authorization parameters in order for this feature to work.
\Ticket{5304}

\item \Condor{q} has a new option \Opt{-schedd-constraint} which can be used
to constrain the queues displayed when using the \Opt{-global} option.
\Ticket{5043}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item 

\Condor{history} \-run on a pool with partitionable slots now shows
the correct dynamic slot.
\Ticket{4261}


\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-8-5-0}Version 8.5.0}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

%\item HTCondor version 8.5.0 not yet released.
\item HTCondor version 8.5.0 released on October 12, 2015.

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item The \Condor{startd} history file contains two new attributes: BadputCausedByDraining and BadputCausedByPreemption, two boolean-valued attributes which are true if the job was evicted not by a user request.
\Ticket{5255}

\item The python bindings have a new Claim API, allowing Computing-On-Demand (COD) to be
invoked via python.
\Ticket{5130}

\item The python bindings can now submit multiple distinct processes using the \texttt{submitMany}
method, similar to a \Condor{submit} file with multiple \texttt{queue} statements.
\Ticket{4916}

\item The python bindings now provide improved support for managing multiple concurrent queries.
\Ticket{5187}

\item As an experimental feature, the python bindings implement the HTCondor negotiation protocol.
\Ticket{5125}

\item Changed \AdStr{Condor} to \AdStr{HTCondor} in \Condor{dagman}
output (mainly in the \File{dagman}.out file).
\Ticket{5144}

\item The new configuration parameter \MacroNI{JOB\_SPOOL\_PERMISSIONS}
controls the permissions on a job's spool directory managed by the
\Condor{schedd} on unix.
It defaults to the value \Expr{user}, which results in a permissions
value of \Expr{0700}.
Other valid values are \Expr{group} (permissions \Expr{0750}) and
\Expr{world} (permissions \Expr{0755}).
Previously, all job spool directories had access permissions of \Expr{0755}.
\Ticket{4896}

\item The \Condor{schedd} no longer changes the ownership of spooled job
files that it manages.
Now, the files are always owned by the submitting user.
The previous behavior of changing ownership to/from the \Expr{condor}
account can be restored by setting the new configuration parameter
\Macro{CHOWN\_JOB\_SPOOL\_FILES} to \Expr{True}.
\Ticket{5226}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}
