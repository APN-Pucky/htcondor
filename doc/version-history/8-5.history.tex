\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item HTCondor version 8.5.0 not yet released.
%\item HTCondor version 8.5.0 released on Month Date, 2015.

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item The \Condor{startd} history file contains two new attributes: BadputCausedByDraining and BadputCausedByPreemption, two boolean-valued attributes which are true if the job was evicted not by a user request.
\Ticket{5255}

\item The python bindings have a new Claim API, allowing Computing-On-Demand (COD) to be
invoked via python.
\Ticket{5130}

\item The python bindings can now submit multiple distinct processes using the \texttt{submitMany}
method, similar to a \Condor{submit} file with multiple \texttt{queue} statements.
\Ticket{4916}

\item The python bindings now provide improved support for managing multiple concurrent queries.
\Ticket{5187}

\item As an experimental feature, the python bindings implement the HTCondor negotiation protocol.
\Ticket{5125}

\item Changed \AdStr{Condor} to \AdStr{HTCondor} in \Condor{dagman}
output (mainly in the \File{dagman}.out file).
\Ticket{5144}

\item The new configuration parameter \MacroNI{JOB\_SPOOL\_PERMISSIONS}
controls the permissions on a job's spool directory managed by the
\Condor{schedd} on unix.
It defaults to the value \Expr{user}, which results in a permissions
value of \Expr{0700}.
Other valid values are \Expr{group} (permissions \Expr{0750}) and
\Expr{world} (permissions \Expr{0755}).
Previously, all job spool directories had access permissions of \Expr{0755}.
\Ticket{4896}
