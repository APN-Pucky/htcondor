%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This is a stable release series of HTCondor.

will be provided in future 8.6.x releases.
New features will be added in the 8.7.x development series.

\subsection*{\label{sec:New-8-6-0}Version 8.6.0}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item HTCondor version 8.6.0 not yet released.
%\item HTCondor version 8.6.0 released on Month Date, 2017.

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item Added two new job classad attributes, \Macro{CumulativeRemoteSysCpu} and 
\Macro{CumulativeRemoteUserCpu}, which keep a running total of system and user
cpu usage, respectively, across all job restarts.  Also, immediately clear attributes
\Macro{RemoteSysCpu} and \Macro{RemoveUserCpu} on job start, instead of on first update.
\Ticket{6022}

\item Added a new config knob, ALWAYS\_REUSEADDR, which defaults to false.
When true, it tells condor to set the SO\_REUSEADDR socket option, so that
the schedd can run large numbers of very short jobs without exhausting the
number of local ports needed for shadows.
\Ticket{6040}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item Fixed a race condition when running multiple concurrent jobs on the same claim.
When the starter exits, it notifies the shadow, which tells the startd to kill the starter.
Immediately after the shadows tells the startd, it fetches the next job, and tries to start it.
If the starter hasn't completely exited yet (perhaps it needs to clean up a large sandbox),
it will notice the shadow has closed the command socket, and the starter will go into disconnected
mode, and get confused.  This has been fixed.
\Ticket{6049}

\item Fixed an infelicity with \Condor{submit} -i and docker universe,
where it would start an interactive shell without a container.  Added error
message expressing that this combination is not currently supported.
\Ticket{6083}

\item When a job claimed by the Job Router is held or removed, it is no
longer considered a failure of the job route chosen for that job.
\Ticket{5968}

\item Fixed a bug in recovering a Google Compute Engine (GCE) job if the
\Condor{gridmanager} restarts during submission of the instance request.
\Ticket{6078}

\item Fixed a bug that could cause re-installation of a remote cluster
to fail in Bosco.
\Ticket{6042}

\end{itemize}
