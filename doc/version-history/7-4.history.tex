\item Under windows, if a job ClassAd update from the starter caused the
job periodic hold or remove policy to become true, there was a 20-second
deadlock between the shadow, startd, and starter.

%gittrac #622
\item Fixed a bug that could cause \Condor{dagman} to generate an
illegal rescue DAG if it read events incorrectly in recovery mode
(\Condor{dagman} now checks for events that violate DAG semantics
when reading events in recovery mode, and exits without creating a
rescue DAG if it reads such an event).

% gittrac #744
\item Fixed a bug that could cause \Condor{dagman} to abort if it saw
a combination of a terminated and an aborted event on a node with
retries.

\item Changed some log file warnings in \Condor{dagman} to not be
printed at the default verbosity setting.

\end{itemize}
