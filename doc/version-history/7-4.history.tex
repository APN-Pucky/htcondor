\section{\label{sec:History-7-4}Stable Release Series 7.4}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This is a stable release series of Condor.
As usual, only bug fixes (and potentially, ports to new platforms)
will be provided in future 7.4.x releases.
New features will be added in the 7.5.x development series.

The details of each version are described below.

\subsection*{\label{sec:New-7-4-0}Version 7.4.0}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item The default configuration file now uses
  \MacroNI{ALLOW}/\MacroNI{DENY} in place of
  \MacroNI{HOSTALLOW}/\MacroNI{HOSTDENY}.  We recommend making this
  same change throughout your other configuration files.  That way,
  if your policy depends on the default policy, it should continue to
  work as it did before.  The behavior of these configuration settings
  remains unchanged.  The \MacroNI{ALLOW}/\Macro{DENY} lists are
  added to the \MacroNI{HOSTALLOW}/\MacroNI{HOSTDENY} lists to form the
  authorization policy.  Both styles support the same syntax.  We would
  like to phase out \MacroNI{HOSTALLOW}/\MacroNI{HOSTDENY} to simplify
  the configuration.

\item As of 7.3.2, \Condor{q} \Opt{-xml} output no longer begins with
non-XML consisting of two blank lines followed by a line such as the
following:

\begin{verbatim}
-- Submitter: schedd-name : <IP> : hostname
\end{verbatim}

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item Added \MacroNI{SCHEDD\_JOB\_QUEUE\_LOG\_FLUSH\_DELAY} to set an
upper bound in seconds on how long it takes for changes to the job
ad to be visible to JobRouter and Quill.  The default is 5.
Previously, there was no upper limit.  Typically, other activity in
the job queue, such as jobs being submitted or completed would cause
buffered data to be flushed to disk, so the effective upper bound was
a function of how busy the job queue was.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Configuration Variable Additions and Changes:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item Under windows, if a job ClassAd update from the starter caused the
job periodic hold or remove policy to become true, there was a 20-second
deadlock between the shadow, startd, and starter.

%gittrac #622
\item Fixed a bug that could cause \Condor{dagman} to generate an
illegal rescue DAG if it read events incorrectly in recovery mode
(\Condor{dagman} now checks for events that violate DAG semantics
when reading events in recovery mode, and exits without creating a
rescue DAG if it reads such an event).

% gittrac #744
\item Fixed a bug that could cause \Condor{dagman} to abort if it saw
a combination of a terminated and an aborted event on a node with
retries.

\item Changed some log file warnings in \Condor{dagman} to not be
printed at the default verbosity setting.

\item Fixed a bug originating in 7.1.4.  When a user submitted a job
with an executable that did not have execute permission enabled, and
Condor was running as root, and transfer-files mode was being used,
Condor failed to automatically turn on execute permission after
transferring the file.

\item Fixed a bug from 7.3.2.  The configuration variable
\MacroNI{COUNT\_HYPERTHREAD\_CPUS} was ignored and was effectively
treated as False in all cases.

\item JobRouter was not able to see matchmaking diagnostic attributes
such as \Attr{LastRejMatchTime}.  Therefore, when evaluating policy
expressions that referred to these attributes, they were effectively
treated as though undefined.  Quill was also not able to see these
attributes.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Known Bugs:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Additions and Changes to the Manual:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}
