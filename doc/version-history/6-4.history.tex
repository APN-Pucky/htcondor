\section{\label{sec:History-6-4}Stable Release Series 6.4}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This is the stable release series of Condor.
New features will be added and tested in the 6.5 development series. 
The details of each version are described below.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{\label{sec:New-6-4-3}Version 6.4.3}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent New Features:
\begin{itemize}

\item Added a \Opt{-hold} and \Opt{-held} option to \Condor{q} which 
displays the reason that the job had been held.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:
\begin{itemize}

\item Fixed a bug where more than one space between arguments to a job
in the java universe would result in it being invoked with and incorrect
list arguments.

\item Removed renaming of the executable to ``condor_exec'' in the java
universe. This fixes a bug where the JVM was looking at its path to determine
its installation directory.

\item Fixed a bug and resulting null pointer exception in the java universe
because under certain conditions, Condor would invoke the JVM incorrectly.

\item Fixed serveral error reporting messages to be more precise.

\item When the NIS environment was being used, the \Condor{starter} daemon
would produce heavy amounts of NIS traffic. This has been fixed.

\item Binary characters in the \File{StarterLog} file and a possible
segmentation fault have been fixed.

\item Fixed \Cmd{select}{2} in the standard universe on our Linux ports.

\item Fixed a small bug in \Condor{q} that was displaying the wrong
username for ``niceuser'' jobs.

\item Fixed a bug where, in the standard universe, you could not open a file
whose name had spaces in it.

\item Fixed a bug in DAGMan where pre and post scripts would fail to
run if the DAG description file had extra whitespace.
Also, reworded the error messages DAGMan produces when it fails to
parse the DAG description file to be more clear and helpful for
solving the problem.

\item Fixed some misleading error messages in the Condor log files
when there were permission problems trying to execute a program. 

\end{itemize}

\noindent Known Bugs:
\begin{itemize}

\item You may not open a file in the standard universe whose name contains a
colon ``:''.

\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

leaves the Java abilities of Condor unconfigured.

\end{itemize}
