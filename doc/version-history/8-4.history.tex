\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item The \Condor{starter} lowers the OOM (out of memory) score of jobs
so the OOM killer is more likely to chose an HTCondor job rather than
an HTCondor daemon or other user process.
\Ticket{5249}

\item Job submission fails if X.509 certificates are advertised with EC2 
grid universe jobs.
Therefore EC2 grid universe jobs no longer advertise their access keys.
\Ticket{5252}
