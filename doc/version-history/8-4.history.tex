\section{\label{sec:History-8-4}Stable Release Series 8.4}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This is a stable release series of HTCondor.
As usual, only bug fixes (and potentially, ports to new platforms)
will be provided in future 8.4.x releases.
New features will be added in the 8.5.x development series.

The details of each version are described below.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-8-4-1}Version 8.4.1}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item HTCondor version 8.4.1 not yet released.
%\item HTCondor version 8.4.1 released on Month Date, 2015.

\end{itemize}

\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item Fixed a bug where the \Condor{kbdd} could not accurately measure
the keyboard idle time.  This daemon now works correctly on Linux systems
whose X server support the MIT screen saver extension.
\Ticket{5265}

\item Fixed a bug which prevented SOAP submissions.
\Ticket{5260}

\item The parameter \Macro{STARTD\_HISTORY} is now set to record
the job histories per startd, in the log directory of the
execute machine. These can be read with the \Condor{history} command.
Previously the default was not to record these.
\Ticket{5257}

\item The parameter \Macro{SCHEDD\_USE\_SLOT\_WEIGHT} now defaults to
true, so that SLOT\_WEIGHT can be used with hierarchical group quotas
and partitionable slots.
\Ticket{5256}

\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-8-4-0}Version 8.4.0}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

%\item HTCondor version 8.4.0 not yet released.
\item HTCondor version 8.4.0 released on September 14, 2015.

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item Fixed a bug introduced in HTCondor version 8.3.7 that caused the
\Condor{shared\_port} daemon to leak file descriptors.
Also made HTCondor work better when some HTCondor daemons
are using shared port, but the \Condor{master} is not.
\Ticket{5259}

\item The \Condor{starter} lowers the OOM (out of memory) score of jobs
so the OOM killer is more likely to chose an HTCondor job rather than
an HTCondor daemon or other user process.
\Ticket{5249}

\item Job submission fails if X.509 certificates are advertised with EC2 
grid universe jobs.
Therefore EC2 grid universe jobs no longer advertise their access keys.
\Ticket{5252}

\end{itemize}
