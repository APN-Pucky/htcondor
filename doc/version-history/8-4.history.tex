\section{\label{sec:History-8-4}Stable Release Series 8.4}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This is a stable release series of HTCondor.
As usual, only bug fixes (and potentially, ports to new platforms)
will be provided in future 8.4.x releases.
New features will be added in the 8.5.x development series.

The details of each version are described below.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-8-4-1}Version 8.4.1}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item HTCondor version 8.4.1 not yet released.
%\item HTCondor version 8.4.1 released on Month Date, 2015.

\end{itemize}

\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item Added four policy metaknobs to simplify configuring a policy
	to either preempt or hold jobs that use more memory
	or CPU cores than provisioned in the slot. See the \MacroNI{POLICY}
	category of metaknobs in section~\ref{usecategory:POLICY} for
	additional information.
\Ticket{5250}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item Fixed a bug where the \Condor{kbdd} could not accurately measure
the keyboard idle time.  This daemon now works correctly on Linux systems
whose X server support the MIT screen saver extension.
\Ticket{5265}

\item Fixed a bug which prevented SOAP submissions.
\Ticket{5260}

\item The parameter \Macro{STARTD\_HISTORY} is now set to record
the job histories per startd, in the log directory of the
execute machine. These can be read with the \Condor{history} command.
Previously the default was not to record these.
\Ticket{5257}

\item The parameter \Macro{SCHEDD\_USE\_SLOT\_WEIGHT} now defaults to
true, so that SLOT\_WEIGHT can be used with hierarchical group quotas
and partitionable slots.
\Ticket{5256}

\item Fixed bug whereby occasionally the command-line tools would
	emit debug messages to stderr with text ``I am: hostname: \ldots''.
\Ticket{5276}

\item Fixed a bug that prevented node retries from working on DAG
nodes that are DAG-level NOOP nodes.  (This bug has existed at least since
the 8.2 series.)
\Ticket{5277}

\item Fixed a problem when the HTCondor executables were not compiled
with \Env{RPATH} enabled on Enterprise Linux 6 platforms. \Env{RPATH} is used
to load Globus and other libraries from the condor-externals RPM.
\Ticket{5294}

\item The job attribute \Attr{JobCurrentStartTransferOutputDate} is now
properly reported in the job ad.
\Ticket{5298}

\item Fixed configuration parameter \MacroNI{NETWORK\_HOSTNAME}, which was
broken starting with version 8.3.2.
\Ticket{5288}

\item Fixed a bug that could cause the Job Router to crash when
invoking a transformation hook.
\Ticket{5224}

\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-8-4-0}Version 8.4.0}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

%\item HTCondor version 8.4.0 not yet released.
\item HTCondor version 8.4.0 released on September 14, 2015.

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item Fixed a bug introduced in HTCondor version 8.3.7 that caused the
\Condor{shared\_port} daemon to leak file descriptors.
Also made HTCondor work better when some HTCondor daemons
are using shared port, but the \Condor{master} is not.
\Ticket{5259}

\item The \Condor{starter} lowers the OOM (out of memory) score of jobs
so the OOM killer is more likely to chose an HTCondor job rather than
an HTCondor daemon or other user process.
\Ticket{5249}

\item Job submission fails if X.509 certificates are advertised with EC2 
grid universe jobs.
Therefore EC2 grid universe jobs no longer advertise their access keys.
\Ticket{5252}

\end{itemize}
