\section{\label{sec:History-8-4}Stable Release Series 8.4}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This is a stable release series of HTCondor.
As usual, only bug fixes (and potentially, ports to new platforms)
will be provided in future 8.4.x releases.
New features will be added in the 8.5.x development series.

The details of each version are described below.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-8-4-2}Version 8.4.2}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item HTCondor version 8.4.2 not yet released.
%\item HTCondor version 8.4.2 released on Month Date, 2015.

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item Fixed a crash in the \Condor{schedd} that happened when the
schedd was under load and being shutdown in the fast mode.
\Ticket{5371}

\item Fixed \MacroNI{TCP\_FORWARDING\_HOST}.  (It now changes how HTCondor
version 8.3.6 and higher contact the daemon configured with it.)
\Ticket{5339}

\item Added a default request\_memory for \Condor{submit} -interactive
of 512 megabytes.  Formerly, the default was one, which is
insufficient in environments that strictly enforce memory
usage.
\Ticket{5344}

\item Added a timeout to the \Condor{fetchlog} command so that it
will not hang forever waiting for a unresponsive daemon.
\Ticket{5325}

\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-8-4-1}Version 8.4.1}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item HTCondor version 8.4.1 released on October 27, 2015.

\end{itemize}

\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item Added support to allow an admin to always volume mount
	certain directories into docker universe containers running
	on a host.
\Ticket{5308}

\item Added four policy metaknobs to simplify configuring a policy
	to either preempt or hold jobs that use more memory
	or CPU cores than provisioned in the slot. See the \MacroNI{POLICY}
	category of metaknobs in section~\ref{usecategory:POLICY} for
	additional information.
\Ticket{5250}

\item Added configuration variables and documentation so that we uniformly prefer
    \Macro{<var>\_ATTRS} over \Macro{<var>\_EXPRS} but support both. This includes
    \Macro{STARTD\_ATTRS}, \Macro{STARTD\_JOB\_ATTRS} and \Macro{SUBMIT\_ATTRS}
    which are often used by HTCondor sites which customize the configuration. These
    configuration variables are now exclusively for use by HTCondor administrators;
    The former default values for these variables have been moved into other configuration
    which is reserved for use by HTCondor developers.  This is done to prevent administrators
    from accidently removing the necessary defaults.
    A warning about use of \Macro{STARTD\_EXPRS} has been disabled unless
    \Macro{STARTD\_ATTRS} or\Macro{SLOT\_TYPE\_<n>\_STARTD\_ATTRS} is also used, since
    the use all three of these at the same time is not supported.
\Ticket{5326}

\item When \Condor{reconfig} and \Condor{restart} are run as root
    they will check to see if the condor user has read access to all of the
    configuration files before sending the command. This is done to prevent aborting the daemons
    accidently by sending reconfig after the admin creates a new config file and
    forgets to give the condor user read access to that file.
\Ticket{4506}

\item Added the \Opt{-natural} sort option to \Condor{status} to sort the slots
    in numerical order rather than alphabetical order.
\Ticket{5131}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item When cgroups are enabled, and CGROUP\_MEMORY\_POLICY is soft, 
HTCondor now also sets the hard limit to the virtual memory limit
of the job, if there is one.
\Ticket{5280}

\item If cgroups are enabled, and a job goes over the memory limit, the
cgroup OOM killer fires, and the job is put on hold.  HTCondor now
updates the job's memory usage statistics with the most up to date
usage, instead of relying on the previous snapshop.
\Ticket{5341}

\item Fixed a bug where the \Condor{kbdd} could not accurately measure
the keyboard idle time.  This daemon now works correctly on Linux systems
whose X server support the MIT screen saver extension.
\Ticket{5265}

\item Fixed a bug which prevented SOAP submissions.
\Ticket{5260}

\item The parameter \Macro{STARTD\_HISTORY} is now set to record
the job histories per startd, in the log directory of the
execute machine. These can be read with the \Condor{history} command.
Previously the default was not to record these.
\Ticket{5257}

\item The parameter \Macro{SCHEDD\_USE\_SLOT\_WEIGHT} now defaults to
true, so that SLOT\_WEIGHT can be used with hierarchical group quotas
and partitionable slots.
\Ticket{5256}

\item Fixed bug whereby occasionally the command-line tools would
	emit debug messages to stderr with text ``I am: hostname: \ldots''.
\Ticket{5276}

\item Fixed a bug that prevented node retries from working on DAG
nodes that are DAG-level NOOP nodes.  (This bug has existed at least since
the 8.2 series.)
\Ticket{5277}

\item Fixed a problem when the HTCondor executables were not compiled
with \Env{RPATH} enabled on Enterprise Linux 6 platforms. \Env{RPATH} is used
to load Globus and other libraries from the condor-externals RPM.
\Ticket{5294}

\item The job attribute \Attr{JobCurrentStartTransferOutputDate} is now
properly reported in the job ad.
\Ticket{5298}

\item Fixed configuration parameter \MacroNI{NETWORK\_HOSTNAME}, which was
broken starting with version 8.3.2.
\Ticket{5288}

\item Fixed a bug that could cause the Job Router to crash when
invoking a transformation hook.
\Ticket{5224}

\item Fixed several memory leaks in the \Prog{nordugrid\_gahp}.
\Ticket{5322}

\item Improved the \Prog{batch\_gahp} to better handle batch systems
that reuse job IDs.
\Ticket{5062}

\item When the \Prog{batch\_gahp} rejects a request because it is
overloaded, the \Condor{gridmanager} now reduces the rate of requests
and retries the rejected request later.
\Ticket{5253}

\item Fixed a bug that could cause a daemon to be in the wrong
privilege state when attempting to act as the user.
\Ticket{4522}

\item The \Condor{had} and \Condor{replication} daemons now work properly
when Shared Port is enabled. They still require their own dedicated ports.
\Ticket{5301}

\item Fixed a bug that cause \Condor{mips} to report numbers about 40 percent lower than it should
on Linux platforms.
\Ticket{5261}

\item Fixed a bug in \Condor{install} that would cause it to configure HTCondor to advertise the public
IP addresses to the collector even when using localhost or 127.0.0.1 for a personal HTCondor.
\Ticket{5286}

\item Fixed a bug in \Condor{q} that caused slices in the Queue statement to be treated as part of the
arguments filename when the slice was longer than 8 characters.
\Ticket{5273}

\item Added SELinux type enforcment rules to allow the \Condor{schedd} to be
able to access user files in NFS mounted file systems.
\Ticket{5343}
\end{itemize}

\noindent Known Issue:
\begin{itemize}
\item \MacroNI{TCP\_FORWARDING\_HOST} is disregarded by HTCondor clients
starting in version 8.3.6.  This bug will be fixed in version 8.4.2 and 8.5.1.
\Ticket{5339}
\end{itemize}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-8-4-0}Version 8.4.0}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

%\item HTCondor version 8.4.0 not yet released.
\item HTCondor version 8.4.0 released on September 14, 2015.

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item Fixed a bug introduced in HTCondor version 8.3.7 that caused the
\Condor{shared\_port} daemon to leak file descriptors.
Also made HTCondor work better when some HTCondor daemons
are using shared port, but the \Condor{master} is not.
\Ticket{5259}

\item The \Condor{starter} lowers the OOM (out of memory) score of jobs
so the OOM killer is more likely to chose an HTCondor job rather than
an HTCondor daemon or other user process.
\Ticket{5249}

\item Job submission fails if X.509 certificates are advertised with EC2 
grid universe jobs.
Therefore EC2 grid universe jobs no longer advertise their access keys.
\Ticket{5252}

\end{itemize}
