% gittrack 1928
\item \AdAttr{JobUniverse} was documented as an optional attribute for
  jobs created via the fetch-work hook, but it was effectively
  required, because the default \AdAttr{IsValidCheckpointPlatform}
  expression evaluated to \Expr{undefined} without it.  Now the
  default \AdAttr{IsValidCheckpointPlatform} expression evaluates to
  \Expr{true} when \AdAttr{JobUniverse} is not defined.
