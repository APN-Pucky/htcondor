\section{\label{sec:History-7-7}Development Release Series 7.7}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This is the development release series of Condor.
The details of each version are described below.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-7-7-0}Version 7.7.0}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item Condor version 7.7.0 not yet released.
%\item Condor version 7.7.0 released on Month Date, 2011.

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item \Condor{q} now supports the new option \Opt{-stream-results}.
  When this option is specified, \Condor{q} displays results as they
  are fetched from the job queue, rather than buffering up the query
  results before displaying anything.

% #1871 commit e4cce6996764a5eaabb28106c44f901c23dc4bae
\item The new submit description file command \SubmitCmd{stack\_size} 
  applies to Linux jobs that are not running in the standard universe. 
  This also advertises the job ClassAd attribute \AdAttr{StackSize}.

% gittrac #1550
\item The new ClassAd function \Code{stringListsIntersect} evaluates
  to true if two strings of delimited elements have any matching elements
  and it evaluates to false otherwise.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Configuration Variable and ClassAd Attribute Additions and Changes:

\begin{itemize}

\item For a job with an X.509 proxy credential, the new job ClassAd
attribute \AdAttr{X509UserProxyEmail} is the email address extracted
from the proxy.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

% gittrack 1928
\item \AdAttr{JobUniverse} was effectively a required attribute for
  jobs created via the Fetch Work hook,
  due to the need to set the \MacroNI{IS\_VALID\_CHECKPOINT\_PLATFORM}
  expression, such that it would not evaluate to \Expr{Undefined}.
  Now the default \MacroNI{IS\_VALID\_CHECKPOINT\_PLATFORM} expression
  evaluates to \Expr{True} when \AdAttr{JobUniverse} is not defined.

% gittrack 1943
\item When there are multiple cpus but only one slot, the slot name no
longer begins with \Expr{slot1@}.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Known Bugs:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Additions and Changes to the Manual:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}
