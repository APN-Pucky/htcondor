The details of each version are described below.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-7-7-0}Version 7.7.0}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item Condor version 7.7.0 not yet released.
%\item Condor version 7.7.0 released on Month Date, 2011.

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item \Condor{q} now supports a new option \Opt{-stream-results}.
  When this option is specified, \Condor{q} displays results as they
  are fetched from the job queue, rather than buffering up the query
  results before displaying anything.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Configuration Variable and ClassAd Attribute Additions and Changes:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

% gittrack 1928
\item \AdAttr{JobUniverse} was documented as an optional attribute for
  jobs created via the fetch-work hook, but it was effectively
  required, because the default \AdAttr{IsValidCheckpointPlatform}
  expression evaluated to \Expr{undefined} without it.  Now the
  default \AdAttr{IsValidCheckpointPlatform} expression evaluates to
  \Expr{true} when \AdAttr{JobUniverse} is not defined.

% gittrack 1943
\item When there are multiple cpus but only one slot, the slot name no
longer begins with ``slot1@''.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Known Bugs:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Additions and Changes to the Manual:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}
