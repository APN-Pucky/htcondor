\subsection*{\label{sec:New-8-7-0}Version 8.7.0}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item HTCondor version 8.7.0 released on March 2, 2017.

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item Optimized the code that reads reads ClassAds off the wire making the maximum possible update rate
for the Collector about 1.7 times higher than it was before.
\Ticket{6105}
\Ticket{6130}

\item New statistics have been added to the Collector ad to show time spent handling queries.
\Ticket{6123}

\item Changed the formatting of the printing of ClassAd expressions with
parentheses. Now there is no space character after every open parenthesis, or
before every close parenthesis
This looks more natural, is somewhat faster for the condor to parse, and
saves space.  That is, an expression that used to print like

\begin{verbatim}
( ( ( foo ) ) )
\end{verbatim}
now will print like this
\begin{verbatim}
(((foo)))
\end{verbatim}
\Ticket{6082}

\item Technology preview of the HTCondor Annex. The HTCondor Annex allows one
to extend their HTCondor pool into the cloud.

\Ticket{6121}

\item Added \Opt{-annex} option to \Condor{status} and \Condor{off}.  Requires
an argument; the request is constrained to match machines whose
\Expr{AnnexName} ClassAd attribute matches the argument.
\Ticket{6116}
\Ticket{6117}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item Removed redundant updates to the job queue by the Job Router.
\Ticket{6102}

\end{itemize}
