\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item Updated \AdAttr{Arch} to better reflect the architectures supported 
      under Windows. The three most commonly seen values will now be: 
      \AdStr{INTEL} (aka x68), \AdStr{IA64} (Intel Itanium), and 
      \AdStr{X86\_64} (for both AMD and Intel 64-bit processors).
      For further information, please see the unnumbered subsection 
      labeled Machine ClassAd Attributes on 
      page~\pageref{sec:Machine-ClassAd-Attributes}.

\item The Windows MSI installer now supports extended VM Universe 
      options. These new options include: the ability to set the 
      networking type; how much memory VM Universe can use on a host; 
      and the ability to set the version of VMware installed on the host.

\item The \Condor{status} and \Condor{q} command line tools now have a
version option which prints the version of those specific tools.  This
can be useful when multiple versions of Condor are installed on the
same machine.
