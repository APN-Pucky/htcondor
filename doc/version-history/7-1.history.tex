\section{\label{sec:History-7-1}Development Release Series 7.1}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This is the development release series of Condor.
The details of each version are described below.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-7-1-0}Version 7.1.0}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

% PR 888/921
\item Added the capability to insert commands into the \File{.condor.sub}
  file produced by \Condor{submit\_dag} with the \Opt{-append} and
  \Opt{-insert\_sub\_file} command-line arguments to \Condor{submit\_dag} and
  the \Macro{DAGMAN\_INSERT\_SUB\_FILE} configuration variable.
  See the \Condor{submit\_dag} manual page on
  page~\pageref{man-condor-submit-dag}
  and the configuration variable definition on
  page~\pageref{param:DAGManInsertSubFile} for more information.

\item For platforms running a Windows operating system, the \Attr{Arch}
  machine ClassAd attribute more correctly reflects the architectures
  supported.  Instead of values \AdStr{INTEL} and \AdStr{UNDEFINED},
  the values will now be: \AdStr{INTEL} for x86,
  \AdStr{IA64} for Intel Itanium,
  and \AdStr{X86\_64} for both AMD and Intel 64-bit processors.
  These values are listed in the unnumbered subsection labeled
  Machine ClassAd Attributes on page~\pageref{sec:Machine-ClassAd-Attributes}.

\item The Windows MSI installer now supports extended \SubmitCmd{vm} universe 
  options. These new options include: the ability to set the 
  networking type, how much memory the \SubmitCmd{vm} universe can use 
  on a host, and
  the ability to set the version of \Prog{VMware} installed on the host.

\item The \Condor{status} and \Condor{q} command line tools now have a
  version option which prints the version of those specific tools.  This
  can be useful when multiple versions of Condor are installed on the
  same machine.

\item The configuration variable \MacroNI{CONDOR\_VIEW\_HOST} may now
  contain a port number and may (if desired) refer to a
  \Condor{collector} daemon running on the same host as the
  \Condor{collector} that is forwarding ads.  It is also now possible to
  use the forwarded ads for matchmaking purposes.  For example, several
  collectors could forward ads to a single aggregating collector which
  a \Condor{negotiator} then uses as its source of information for
  matchmaking.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Configuration Variable Additions and Changes:

\begin{itemize}

% PR 921
\item Added the \Macro{DAGMAN\_INSERT\_SUB\_FILE} variable, which allows a file
  of commands to be inserted into \File{.condor.sub} files generated
  by \Condor{submit\_dag}.  See page~\pageref{param:DAGManInsertSubFile}
  for more information.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item The Condor Build ID is now printed by \Condor{version} and placed 
  in the logs for machines running a Windows operating system.

\item \Condor{quill} and the \Condor{dbmsd} correctly register 
  themselves with the Windows firewall.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Known Bugs:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Additions and Changes to the Manual:

\begin{itemize}

\item Added \AdStr{WINNT60} for the Vista operating system to
  the documented list of possible values for the machine ClassAd
  attribute \AdAttr{OpSys}.

\end{itemize}
