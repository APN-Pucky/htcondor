Upgrading from the 8.6 series of HTCondor to the 8.8 series
will bring new features introduced in the 8.7 series of HTCondor.
These new features include the following (note that this list contains
only the most significant changes; a full list of changes can be
found in the version history:~\ref{sec:History-8-7}):

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}

Upgrading from the 8.6 series of HTCondor to the 8.8 series will
also introduce changes that administrators and users of sites running
from an older HTCondor version should be aware of when planning an upgrade.
Here is a list of items that administrators should be aware of.

\begin{itemize}

\item
% Job Router route selection change, now first-match instead of
% round robin
\Ticket{6190}

\item
% PREEMPTION_REQUIREMENTS in the negotiator no longer has a hard-code
% check that the preempting user has a better fair-share user priority
% than the running user.
% Overly-lax expressions ('True' being the worst) will lead to slots
% being preempted every negotiation cycle.
% Suggest one of the following always be a clause in the expression:
% For pools with fair-share only:
%   RemoteUserPrio > TARGET.SubmitterUserPrio * 1.2
% For pools with groups and quotas:
%   (SubmitterGroupResourcesInUse < SubmitterGroupQuota) && (RemoteGroupResourcesInUse > RemoteGroupQuota)
\Ticket{4699}

\end{itemize}
