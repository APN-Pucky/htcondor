\section{Development Release Series 8.9}\label{sec:History-8-9}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This is the development release series of HTCondor.
The details of each version are described below.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-8-9-1}Version 8.9.1}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item HTCondor version 8.9.1 not yet released.
%\item HTCondor version 8.9.1 released on Month Date, 2019.

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item The performance of HTCondor's File Transfer mechanism has improved when
	sending multiple files, especially in wide-area network settings.
\Ticket{6884}

\item We've added six new events to the job event log, recording details
about file transfer.  For both file transfer -in (before/to the job) and
-out (after/from the job), we log if the transfer was queued, when it started,
and when it finished.  If the event was queued, the start event will note
for how long; the first transfer event written will additionally include
the starter's address, which has not otherwise been printed.

We've also added several transfer-related attributes to the job ad.  For jobs
which do file transfer, we now set
\Attr{JobCurrentFinishTransferOutputDate}, to complement
\Attr{JobCurrentStartTransferOutputDate}, as well as the corresponding
attributes for input transfer:
\Attr{JobCurrentStartTransferInputDate} and
\Attr{JobCurrentFinishTransferInputDate}.  The new attributes are added at
the same time as \Attr{JobCurrentStartTransferOutputDate}, that is, at
job termination.  This set of attributes use the older and more deceptive
definitions of file transfer timing.  To obtain the times recorded by the
new events, instead reference \Attr{TransferInQueued},
\Attr{TransferInStarted}, \Attr{TransferInFinished},
\Attr{TransferOutQueued}, \Attr{TransferOutStarted}, and
\Attr{TransferOutFinished}.  HTCondor sets these attributes (roughly) at
the time they occur.

\Ticket{6854}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item Avoid killing jobs using between 90\% and 99\% of memory limit. 
\Ticket{6925}

\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-8-9-0}Version 8.9.0}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item HTCondor version 8.9.0 not yet released.
%\item HTCondor version 8.9.0 released on Month Date, 2018.

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item  Normally, HTCondor requires the user to specify their credentials
when using EC2 (via the grid universe or via \Condor{annex}).  This allows
users to use different accounts from the same machine.  However,
if a user started an EC2 instance with the privileges necessary to start
other instances, and ran HTCondor in that instance, HTCondor was unable to
use that instance's privileges; the user still had to specify their
credentials.  Instead, the user may now specify \Expr{FROM INSTANCE} instead
of the name of a credential file to indicate that HTCondor should use the
instance's credentials.

By default, any user with access to a privileged EC2 instance has access to
that instance's privileges.  If you would like to make use of this feature,
please read \ref{sec:Instance Roles} before adding privileges (an instance
role) to an instance which allows access by other users, specifically
including the submitting of jobs to or running jobs on that instance.
\Ticket{6789}

\item the \Condor{hdfs} daemon which allowed the hdfs daemons to run under
the \Condor{master} has been removed from the contributed source. 
\Ticket{6809}

\item Scheduler Universe jobs now start in order of priority, instead of random 
order. This is most typically used for DAGMan. When running \Condor{submit\_dag}
against a .dag file, you can use the -priority <N> flag to set the priority
for the overall \Condor{dagman} job. When the \Condor{schedd} is starting new 
Scheduler Universe jobs, the highest priority queued job will start first. If 
all queued Scheduler Universe jobs have equal priority, they get started in 
order of submission.
\Ticket{6703}

\item A family of HTCondor daemons can now share a security session that
allows them to trust each other without doing a security negotiation
when a network connection is made amongst them.
This ``family'' security session can be disabled by setting the new
configuration parameter \MacroNI{SEC\_USE\_FAMILY\_SESSION} to \Expr{False}.
\Ticket{6788}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item Fixed potential authentication failures between the \Condor{schedd}
and \Condor{startd} when multiple \Condor{startd}s are using the same
shared port server.
\Ticket{5604}

\end{itemize}
