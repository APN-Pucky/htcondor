%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item Added support for vanilla and Java jobs to reconnect when the
  connection between the submitting and execution nodes is lost for
  any reason.
  Possible reasons for this disconnect include: network outages,
  rebooting the submit machine, restarting the Condor daemons on the
  submit machine, etc.
  If the execution machine is rebooted or the Condor daemons are
  restarted, reconnection is not possible.
  To take advantage of this reconnect feature, jobs must be submitted
  with a \Attr{JobLeaseDuration}.
  There are new events in the UserLog related to disconnect and
  reconnect.

\item Added a new Condor tool, \Condor{vacate\_job}.
  This command is similar to \Condor{vacate}, except the kinds of
  arguments it takes define jobs in a job queue, not machines to
  vacate.
  For example, a user can vacate a specific job id, all the jobs in a
  given cluster, all the jobs matching a job queue constraint, or even
  all jobs owned by that user.
  The owner of a job can always vacate their own jobs, regardless of
  the pool security policy controlling \Condor{vacate} (which is an
  administrative command which acts directly on machines).
  
\item Scheduler universe jobs on UNIX can now specify a
  \Attr{HoldKillSig}, the signal that should be sent when the job is
  put on hold.
  If not specified, the default is to use the \Attr{KillSig}, and if
  that is not defined, the job will be sent a SIGTERM.
  The submit file keyword to use for defining this signal is
  \AdAttr{hold\_kill\_sig}, for example,
  \verb@hold_kill_sig = SIGUSR1@.

\item Added a \Opt{-num} option to the \Condor{wait} tool to wait for
   a specified number of jobs to finish.

\item Added a configuration option \Macro{STARTER\_JOB\_ENVIRONMENT}
   so the admin can configure the default environment inherited by
   user jobs.
