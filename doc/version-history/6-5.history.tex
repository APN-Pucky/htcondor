\section{\label{sec:History-6-5}Stable Release Series 6.5}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This is the development release series of Condor,
The details of each version are described below.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{\label{sec:New-6-5-0}Version 6.5.0}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\noindent New Features:
\begin{itemize}

\item A fresh value of RemoteWallClock is now used when evaluating
user policy expressions, such as periodic_remove.

\item The IOProxy handler now handles escaped characters (whitespace)
in filenames.

\item condor.boot is now configured to work automatically with RedHat
chkconfig.

\item A new log\_xml option has been added to condor\_submit. It is
documented in the condor\_submit portion of the manual.

\item A new DAGMan option to produce dot files was added. Dot is a
program that creates visualizations of DAGs. This feature is
documented in Section~\ref{sec:DAGMan}.

\item The email report from condor\_preen is now less cryptic, and
more self-explanatory.

\item Specifying full device paths (e.g., ``/dev/mouse'') instead of bare
device names (e.g., ``mouse'') in CONSOLE\_DEVICES in the config file is no
longer an error.

\item The condor\_submit tool now prints a more helpful, specific error if
the specified job executable is not found, or can't be accessed.

\item The startd ``cron'' (Hawkeye) now permits zero length ``prefix''
strings.

\item A number of new Hawkeye modules have been added, and most have
various bug fixes and improvements.

\item Added support for a new config parameter, Q\_QUERY\_TIMEOUT, which
defines the timeout that \Condor{q} uses when communicating with the
\Condor{schedd}.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:
\begin{itemize}

\item Hawkeye will no longer busy-loop if a ``continuous mode''
module with a period of 0 fails to execute for some reason.  (Now, for
continuous mode modules, a period of 0 is automatically reset to be 1, and
a warning appears in the log.)

\end{itemize}

\noindent Known Bugs:
\begin{itemize}

\item DAGMan doesn't detect when users mistakenly specify two
DAG nodes with the same node name; instead it waits for the
same node to complete twice, which never happens, and so DAGMan
goes off into never-never land.

\end{itemize}
