%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This is the development release series of HTCondor.
The details of each version are described below.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-8-1-0}Version 8.1.0}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item HTCondor version 8.1.0 not yet released.
%\item HTCondor version 8.1.0 released on Month Date, 2013.

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item Added support for publishing information about an HTCondor pool to \TM{Ganglia}.
See page~\pageref{sec:Config-gangliad} for more information.
\Ticket{3515}

\item Improved the performance of the \Condor{collector} daemon when running
at sites that do not observe daylight savings time.
\Ticket{2898}

\item \Condor{q}, \Condor{rm}, \Condor{status} and \Condor{qedit} are now 
more consistent in the way they handle the \Opt{-constraint} option.
\Ticket{1156}

\item The new \Condor{dagman\_metrics\_reporter} executable reports metrics 
for DAGMan jobs running under Pegasus.
\Ticket{3532}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Configuration Variable and ClassAd Attribute Additions and Changes:

\begin{itemize}

\item The default values of the configuration variables
\Macro{COLLECTOR\_MAX\_FILE\_DESCRIPTORS} and 
\Macro{SCHEDD\_MAX\_FILE\_DESCRIPTORS} have become 10240 and 4096,
respectively.  This increases the scalability of the default configuration.
\Ticket{3626}

\item The new configuration variable
\Macro{FILE\_TRANSFER\_DISK\_LOAD\_THROTTLE} enables dynamic
adjustment of the level of file transfer concurrency in order to
keep the disk load generated by transfers below a specified level.
Supporting this new feature are configuration variables
\Macro{FILE\_TRANSFER\_DISK\_LOAD\_THROTTLE\_WAIT\_BETWEEN\_INCREMENTS},
\Macro{FILE\_TRANSFER\_DISK\_LOAD\_THROTTLE\_SHORT\_HORIZON}, and
\Macro{FILE\_TRANSFER\_DISK\_LOAD\_THROTTLE\_LONG\_HORIZON}.
\Ticket{3613}

\item The following new \Condor{schedd} ClassAd attributes are for
monitoring file transfer activity:
\AdAttr{TransferQueueMBWaitingToDownload},
\AdAttr{TransferQueueMBWaitingToUpload},
\AdAttr{FileTransferDiskThrottleLevel},
\AdAttr{FileTransferDiskThrottleHigh}, and
\AdAttr{FileTransferDiskThrottleLow}.
\Ticket{3613}

\item The default value for the configuration variable
\Macro{PASSWD\_CACHE\_REFRESH} has been changed from 300 seconds to
72000 seconds (20 hours).
\Ticket{3723}

\item The new configuration variables
\Macro{DAGMAN\_PEGASUS\_REPORT\_METRICS} and
\Macro{DAGMAN\_PEGASUS\_REPORT\_TIMEOUT}
set defaults used by the new \Condor{dagman\_metrics\_reporter} executable,
which reports metrics for DAGMan jobs running under Pegasus.
\Ticket{3532}
\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item HTCondor version 8.0.0 had an unintended change in the Chirp 
wire protocol.
This change caused \Condor{chirp} with the \Opt{put} option
to fail when the execute node
was running HTCondor version 7.8.x or earlier versions. 
HTCondor 8.0.1 and later
versions will now send the original wire protocol, and accept either the
original protocol, or the variant that HTCondor version 8.0.0 sends.
\Ticket{3735}

\item Fixed a bug that could cause the daemons to crash on Unix platforms,
if the operating system reported that a job owner's account 
did not exist, for example due to a temporary NIS or LDAP failure.
\Ticket{3723}

\item Fixed a bug that resulted in a misleading error message when
\Condor{status} with the \Opt{-constraint} option specified a constraint 
that could not be parsed.
\Ticket{1319}

\item Fixed a typo in \Condor{q} output.
\Ticket{3703}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Known Bugs:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Additions and Changes to the Manual:
