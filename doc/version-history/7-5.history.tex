\section{\label{sec:History-7-5}Development Release Series 7.5}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This is the development release series of Condor.
The details of each version are described below.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-7-5-1}Version 7.5.1}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

% gittrac #221
\item The configuration variable
\MacroNI{DELEGATE\_FULL\_JOB\_GSI\_CREDENTIALS} now applies to all proxy
delegations done by Condor.  The value is a boolean and defaults to False,
which means that when doing delegation Condor will now create a limited proxy
instead of a full proxy.

% gittrac #1102
\item A port number defined within \Macro{CONDOR\_VIEW\_HOST} may now use 
  a shared port.

% gittrac #1104
\item The \Condor{master} no longer pauses for 3 seconds after starting
  the \Condor{collector}.  However, if the configuration variable
  \MacroNI{COLLECTOR\_ADDRESS\_FILE} is defines a file, 
  the \Condor{master} will wait for that file to be created
  before starting other daemons.

% gittrac #938
\item Grid universe jobs using the CREAM grid system now batch up
common requests into larger single requests.  This
reduces network traffic, increases the number of parallel tasks
the Condor can handle at once, and reduces the load on the remote
gatekeeper.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Configuration Variable and ClassAd Attribute Additions and Changes:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Known Bugs:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Additions and Changes to the Manual:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-7-5-0}Version 7.5.0}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item All bug fixes and features which are in 7.4.1 are in this 7.5.0 release.

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

% gittrack #892
\item Added the new daemon \Condor{shared\_port} for Unix platforms 
  (except for HPUX).
  It allows Condor daemons to share a
  single network port.  This makes opening access to Condor through a
  firewall easier and safer.  It also increases the scalability of a
  submit node by decreasing port usage. See
  section~\ref{sec:Config-shared-port} for more information.

% gittrack #960
\item Improved CCB's handling of rude NAT/firewalls that silently drop
TCP connections.

% gittrack #968
\item Simplified the publication of daemon addresses.
  \Attr{PublicNetworkIpAddr} and \Attr{PrivateNetworkIpAddr} have been removed.
  \Attr{MyAddress} contains both public and private addresses.  For now,
  \Attr{<Subsys>IpAddr} contains the same information.  In a future release,
  the latter may be removed.

% gittrack #975
\item Changes to \MacroNI{TCP\_FORWARDING\_HOST},
  \MacroNI{PRIVATE\_NETWORK\_ADDRESS}, and
  \MacroNI{PRIVATE\_NETWORK\_NAME} can now be made without requiring a
  full restart.  It may take up to one \Condor{collector} update interval 
  for the changes to become visible.

% gittrack #1002
\item Network compatibility with Condor prior to 6.3.3 is no longer
  supported unless \MacroNI{SEC\_CLIENT\_NEGOTIATION} is set to
  \Expr{NEVER}.  This change removes the risk of communication errors
  causing performance problems resulting from automatic fall-back to the
  old protocol.

% gittrack #930
\item For efficiency, authentication between the \Condor{shadow} and
  \Condor{schedd} daemons is now able to be cached and reused in more
  cases.  Previously, authentication for updating job information was
  only cached if read access was configured to require authentication.

\item \Condor{config\_val} will now report the default value for
  configuration variables that are not set in the configuration files.

% gittrac #939
\item The \Condor{gridmanager} now uses a single status call to obtain
the status of all CREAM grid universe jobs from the remote server.

% gittrac #955
\item The \Condor{gridmanager} will now retry CREAM commands that time out.

% gittrac #941
\item Forwarding a renewed proxy for CREAM grid universe jobs to the
remote server is now much more efficient.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Configuration Variable and ClassAd Attribute Additions and Changes:

\begin{itemize}

% gittrack #997
\item Removed the configuration variable 
  \MacroNI{COLLECTOR\_SOCKET\_CACHE\_SIZE}.
  Configuration of this parameter used to be mandatory to enable TCP updates
  to the \Condor{collector}.  Now no special configuration of the
  \Condor{collector} is required to allow TCP updates, but it is
  important to ensure that there are sufficient file descriptors for
  efficient operation.  See section~\ref{sec:tcp-collector-update} for
  more information.

% gittrack #892
\item The new configuration variable \MacroNI{USE\_SHARED\_PORT} 
  is a boolean value that specifies
  whether a Condor process should rely on the \Condor{shared\_port} daemon for
  receiving incoming connections.  Write access to
  \Macro{DAEMON\_SOCKET\_DIR} is required for this to take effect.
  The default is \Expr{False}.  If set to \Expr{True}, \MacroNI{SHARED\_PORT}
  should be added to \MacroNI{DAEMON\_LIST}.  See
  section~\ref{sec:Config-shared-port} for more information.

% gittrack #960
\item Added the new configuration variable \MacroNI{CCB\_HEARTBEAT\_INTERVAL}.
  It is the maximum
  number of seconds of silence on a daemon's connection to the CCB server
  after which it will ping the server to verify that the connection still
  works.  
  The default value is 1200 (20 minutes).
  This feature serves to both speed
  up detection of dead connections and to generate a guaranteed minimum
  frequency of activity to attempt to prevent the connection from being
  dropped.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item Fixed problem with a ClassAd debug function,
so it now properly emits debug information for ClassAd \Code{IfThenElse}
clauses.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Known Bugs:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Additions and Changes to the Manual:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}
