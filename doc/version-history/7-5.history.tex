\section{\label{sec:History-7-5}Development Release Series 7.5}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This is the development release series of Condor.
The details of each version are described below.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-7-5-0}Version 7.5.0}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

% gittrack #892
\item Added \Condor{shared\_port} under unix (except for HPUX).  This
  allows Condor daemons other than \Condor{collector} to share a
  single network port.  This makes opening access to Condor through a
  firewall easier and safer.  It also increases scalability of the
  submit node by decreasing port usage. See
  section~\ref{sec:Config-shared-port} for more information.

% gittrack #960
\item Improved CCB's handling of rude NAT/firewalls that silently drop
TCP connections.

% gittrack #968
\item Simplified the publication of daemon addresses.
  \Attr{PublicNetworkIpAddr} and \Attr{PrivateNetworkIpAddr} have been removed.
  \Attr{MyAddress} contains both public and private addresses.  For now,
  \Attr{<Subsys>IpAddr} contains the same information.  In a future release,
  the latter may be removed.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Configuration Variable Additions and Changes:

\begin{itemize}

% gittrack #892
\item \MacroNI{USE\_SHARED\_PORT} is a boolean value that specifies
  whether a Condor process should rely on \Condor{shared\_port} for
  receiving incoming connections.  Write access to
  \Macro{DAEMON\_SOCKET\_DIR} is required for this to take effect.
  The default is false.  If this is set to true, \MacroNI{SHARED\_PORT}
  should be added to \MacroNI{DAEMON\_LIST}.  See
  section~\ref{sec:Config-shared-port} for more information.

% gittrack #960
\item Added \MacroNI{CCB\_HEARTBEAT\_INTERVAL}.  This is the maximum
  number of seconds of silence on a daemon's connection to the CCB server
  after which it will ping the server to verify that the connection still
  works.  The default is 20 minutes.  This feature serves to both speed
  up detection of dead connections and to generate a guaranteed minimum
  frequency of activity to attempt to prevent the connection from being
  dropped.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Known Bugs:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Additions and Changes to the Manual:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.
