%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This is the development release series of Condor.
The details of each version are described below.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-7-5-0}Version 7.5.0}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item Added \Condor{shared\_port} under Linux and Mac OS X.  This
  allows Condor daemons other than \Condor{collector} to share a
  single network port.  This makes opening access to Condor through a
  firewall easier and safer.  It also increases scalability of the
  submit node by decreasing port usage. See
  section~\ref{sec:Config-shared-port} for more information.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Configuration Variable Additions and Changes:

\begin{itemize}

\item \MacroNI{USE\_SHARED\_PORT} is a boolean value that specifies
  whether a Condor process should rely on \Condor{shared\_port} for
  receiving incoming connections.  Write access to
  \Macro{DAEMON\_SOCKET\_DIR} is required for this to take effect.
  The default is false.  If this is set to true, \MacroNI{SHARED\_PORT}
  should be added to \MacroNI{DAEMON\_LIST}.  See
  section~\ref{sec:Config-shared-port} for more information.


\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Known Bugs:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Additions and Changes to the Manual:
