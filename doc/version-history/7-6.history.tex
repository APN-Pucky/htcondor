%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This is a stable release series of Condor.
As usual, only bug fixes (and potentially, ports to new platforms)
will be provided in future 7.6.x releases.
New features will be added in the 7.7.x development series.

The details of each version are described below.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-7-6-0}Version 7.6.0}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item Condor version 7.6.0 not yet released.
%\item Condor version 7.6.0 released on Month Date, 2011.

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item Condor can now create and manage virtual machine instances in a
cloud service via Deltacloud. This is done via the new
\SubmitCmd{deltacloud} grid-type in the grid universe.
See section ~\ref{sec:Deltacloud} for details.

% gittrac #1931
\item Improved scalability of submission of grid-type cream jobs.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Configuration Variable and ClassAd Attribute Additions and Changes:

\begin{itemize}

\item The new configuration variable \Macro{DELTACLOUD\_GAHP} specifies
where the \File{deltacloud\_gahp} binary is located. This binary is used to
manage grid-type deltacloud jobs in the grid universe.
In a normal Condor installation, the value should be
\File{\$(SBIN)/deltacloud\_gahp}.

\item Several new job ClassAd attributes have been added to support
grid-type deltacloud in the grid universe.
These attributes are taken from the submit description file:
\AdAttr{DeltacloudUsername},
\AdAttr{DeltacloudPasswordFile},
\AdAttr{DeltacloudImageId},
\AdAttr{DeltacloudRealmId},
\AdAttr{DeltacloudHardwareProfile},
\AdAttr{DeltacloudHardwareProfileCpu},
\AdAttr{DeltacloudHardwareProfileMemory},
\AdAttr{DeltacloudHardwareProfileStorage},
\AdAttr{DeltacloudKeyname}, and
\AdAttr{DeltacloudUserData}.
%\AdAttr{DeltacloudRetryTimeout},
These attributes are set by Condor when the instance runs:
\AdAttr{DeltacloudAvailableActions},
\AdAttr{DeltacloudPrivateNetworkAddresses},
\AdAttr{DeltacloudPublicNetworkAddresses}.
See sections ~\ref{sec:Deltacloud} and ~\ref{sec:Job-ClassAd-Attributes}
for details.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

% gittrac #1957
\item Fixed a bug in \Condor{dagman} that caused it to fail in recovery
mode in the face of a specific combination of node job failures with
retries.

% gittrac #1991
\item Fixed a bug that resulted in the spooled user log not being
  fetched by \Condor{transfer\_data}.  Prior to Condor 7.5.4, this
  problem affected spooled jobs submitted with an explicit list of
  output files to transfer.  Beginning in 7.5.4, this problem also
  affected spooled jobs that auto-detected output files.

% gittrac #1985
\item When a job is submitted with the -spool option to \Condor{submit},
the \Condor{schedd} now writes the submit event to the user log in its
spool directory. Before, it would try to write the event using the user
log path given to \condor{submit} by the user, which it may not have
access to.

% gittrac #2001
\item Fixed a file descriptor leak in the \condor{vm-gahp}. The leak would
cause the daemon to fail if a VMware job ran for more than 16 hours on a
linux machine.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Known Bugs:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Additions and Changes to the Manual:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}
