% would have been in 7.8.9, but there was no 7.8.9 release
\item Fixed a bug that caused the \Condor{master} daemon on Windows platforms
to think there were new binaries
when changing to and from daylight savings time.
The \Condor{master} daemon would then kill and restart itself,
as well as all of the daemons,
if configuration variable \Macro{MASTER\_NEW\_BINARY\_RESTART} was set
to its default value of \Expr{GRACEFUL}.
