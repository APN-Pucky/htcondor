the shadow, if it calls mmap() with an unsupported combination of flags.

\Ticket{3605}

% would have been in 7.9.7, but there was no 7.9.7 release

The \Condor{master} daemon would then kill and restart itself,
as well as all of the daemons,
if configuration variable \Macro{MASTER\_NEW\_BINARY\_RESTART} was set
to its default value of \Expr{GRACEFUL}.
