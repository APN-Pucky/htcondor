Upgrading from the 8.2 series of HTCondor to the 8.4 series 
will bring new features introduced in the 8.3 series of HTCondor.
These new features include:
\MoreTodo

Upgrading from the 8.2 series of HTCondor to the 8.4 series will
also introduce changes that administrators of sites running from an older
HTCondor version should be aware of when planning an upgrade.  
Here is a list of items that administrators should be aware of.

\begin{itemize}

\item New configuration and changes to existing configuration:
  \begin{itemize}

\item If enabled, the \Condor{shared\_port} daemon will now use port 9618
instead of the previous default, which was to randomly select a port from
the allowed range (from \MacroNI{LOWPORT} to \MacroNI{HIGHPORT}; see section
see section \ref{sec:Ports-Firewalls}).  To restore \Condor{shared\_port}'s
previous behavior, set \MacroNI{SHARED\_PORT\_PORT} to \Expr{0}.
\Ticket{4752}

  \end{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}
