%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item The standard-universe fetch\_files feature was not cleaning up
temporary files on the execution machine.

\item In rare circumstances, a Linux kernel bug results in conflicting
information about system boot time (/proc/stat and /proc/uptime).
Specifically, the "btime" field in /proc/stat suddenly jumps to
the present moment and then stays at that value.  This
was resulting in incorrect estimation of process ages, which caused
Condor's estimation of CondorLoadAvg to be completely wrong.  A more
robust heuristic is now being used.

\item A long configuration line with with continuation lines can cause the
config file parser to not properly skip the leading whitespace from
the continued lines.  This has been corrected.

\item The Grid Monitor now will automatically probe for and work with
``unknown'' batch systems.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Known Bugs:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}
