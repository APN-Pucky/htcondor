This is a stable release series of Condor.
It is based on the 6.5 development series.
All new features added or bugs fixed in the 6.5 series are available
in the 6.6 series.
The details of each version are described below.

\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item The \Condor{dagman} debugging log now reports the total number
      of ``Un-Ready'' Nodes (i.e. those waiting for unfinished
      dependencies) in its periodic summaries.  In the past, the
      omission of this state led to confusion because the total of all
      reported job states didn't always match the total number of jobs
      in the DAG.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item The standard-universe fetch\_files feature was not cleaning up
temporary files on the execution machine.

\item In rare circumstances, a Linux kernel bug results in conflicting
information about system boot time (\File{/proc/stat} and
\File{/proc/uptime}). 
Specifically, the "btime" field in \File{/proc/stat} suddenly jumps to
the present moment and then stays at that value.  This
was resulting in incorrect estimation of process ages, which caused
Condor's estimation of CondorLoadAvg to be completely wrong.  A more
robust heuristic is now being used.

\item A long configuration line with with continuation lines can cause the
config file parser to not properly skip the leading whitespace from
the continued lines.  This has been corrected.

\item The Grid Monitor now will automatically probe for and work with
``unknown'' batch systems.

\item Fixed a bug where under certain circumstances \Condor{dagman}
      would fail to detect an unsuccessful invocation of
      \Condor{submit}, and would instead report the job as
      successfully submitted with job id 0.0.

\item Fixed a bug which was causing problems when a periodic\_remove
expression for a scheduler universe job evaluates to true.  Under
these conditions, the schedd did not log the job terminiation to the
job log.  Addtionally, the schedd would exit with an error status.

\item Fixed a recently-introduced \Condor{dagman} bug where the number
      of node retries (specified with the RETRY keyword) wasn't being
      updated after some failures; instead, the node would be allowed
      to retry indefinitely if it kept failing.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Known Bugs:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}
