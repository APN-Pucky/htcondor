%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This is a stable release series of Condor.
As usual, only bug fixes (and potentially, ports to new platforms)
will be provided in future 7.2.x releases.
New features will be added in the 7.3.x development series.

The details of each version are described below.

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item \Security A flaw was found and fixed that could allow an unauthenticated
user to cause Condor daemons to shut down,
and could allow running jobs to be removed from the queue.

% PR 952
\item Fixed a bug that caused \Condor{dagman} to stay in the Condor queue,
if \Condor{dagman} was accidentally submitted with an empty DAG input file.

\item Fixed a problem in the \Condor{startd} when using
\MacroNI{STARTD\_SLOT\_EXPRS} for attributes that are sometimes
present and sometimes absent from the machine ClassAd.  This is most
typical of attributes that enter the machine ClassAd from the job, via
\MacroNI{STARTD\_JOB\_EXPRS}.  When the attribute went away from slot X
(for example, because the job on slot X finished), the corresponding
\MacroNI{SlotX\_<AttributeName>} attribute was not reliably removed from
all of the other slots.

\item Removed some redundant information from the \Condor{startd} advertisements
to the \Condor{collector}, from within the private ClassAd that is not
user-visible.
This fix reduces UDP traffic and memory usage generated by
the \Condor{startd} by about 20\Percent\
in the \Condor{collector} and \Condor{negotiator}.

\item Fixed the \Condor{master} daemon to correctly preserve \Code{argv[0]}
when restarting itself.
In some cases, the bug confused external utilities that monitor
the \Condor{master} process by looking at the output of \Prog{ps} or
similar programs.

\item Fixed the \Condor{master} daemon to correctly preserve 
to preserve other command-line options when restarting itself,
most notably, \Opt{-pid} and \Opt{-runfor}.

\item Fixed a bug that exhibited itself when
the configuration variable \MacroNI{NEGOTIATOR\_CONSIDER\_PREEMPTION}
was set to \Expr{False}, in which jobs
would not be matched to slots in the backfill state.  Corrected, slots doing
backfill are included in the matchmaking process.

% PR 959
\item \Condor{submit\_dag} now generates a \File{.condor.sub} file with
the submit description file command \SubmitCmd{copy\_to\_spool}
set to \Expr{True}, to ease version upgrades while
large DAGs are running.

\item The \Condor{job\_router} did not work while managing jobs from
multiple users when read access to the \Condor{schedd} required
authentication.  The \Condor{job\_router} was also not able to use
authentication methods other than FS.  Now it can use any
authentication method, as long as the resulting identity is listed in
the configuration variable
\MacroNI{QUEUE\_SUPER\_USERS} or the \Condor{job\_router} and
\Condor{schedd} are running as a Personal Condor in non-root mode.
