%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This is a stable release series of Condor.
As usual, only bug fixes (and potentially, ports to new platforms)
will be provided in future 7.2.x releases.
New features will be added in the 7.3.x development series.

The details of each version are described below.

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Configuration Variable Additions and Changes:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item \Macro{USE\_VISIBLE\_DESKTOP} now works as expected: the current user
is given privileged access to the visible desktop for the duration of a
job.  If the user did not start with these extended permissions, then they
are removed when the job terminates.

\item Fixed a bug that caused \Condor{dagman} to stay in the Condor
queue if it was accidentally submitted with an empty DAG file.

\item Fixed a problem in the \Condor{startd} when using
\MacroNI{STARTD\_SLOT\_EXPRS} for attributes that are sometimes
present and sometimes absent from the machine ad.  This is most
typical of attributes that enter the machine ad from the job, via
\MacroNI{STARTD\_JOB\_EXPRS}.  When the attribute went away from slot
X (e.g. because the job there finished), the corresponding
\MacroNI{SlotX\_<AttributeName>} entry was not reliably removed from
all of the other slots.

\item Removed some redundant information in the startd advertisements
to the collector (in the ``private'' ad that is not user-visible).
This fix reduces startd-generated UDP traffic and memory usage by
about 20\% in the \Condor{collector} and \Condor{negotiator}.

\item \Condor{master} was not preserving argv[0] when restarting
itself.  In some cases, this confused external utilities that monitor
the \Condor{master} process by looking at the output of 'ps' or
something similar.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Known Bugs:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Additions and Changes to the Manual:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}
