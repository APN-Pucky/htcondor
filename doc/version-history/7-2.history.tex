\item Fixed a bug that caused \Condor{dagman} to stay in the Condor
queue if it was accidentally submitted with an empty DAG file.

\item Removed some redundant information in the startd advertisements
to the collector (in the ``private'' ad that is not user-visible).
This fix reduces startd-generated UDP traffic and memory usage by
about 20\% in the \Condor{collector} and \Condor{negotiator}.
