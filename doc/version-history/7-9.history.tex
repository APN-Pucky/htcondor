\section{\label{sec:History-7-9}Development Release Series 7.9}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This is the development release series of Condor.
The details of each version are described below.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-7-9-0}Version 7.9.0}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item Condor version 7.9.0 not yet released.
%\item Condor version 7.9.0 released on Month Date, 2012.

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item Added logging output flag \Dflag{LEVEL} which causes Condor to include the logging level
flags in effect for each line of logging output.
\Ticket{2712}

\item Added -autoformat option to \Condor{status}, behavior is the same as -autoformat option
added to \Condor{q} in 7.7.6.
\Ticket{2941}

\item Enhanced the classad log system (e.g. the job que log) to report the record number on parse failures, 
and improved its ability to detect parse failures closer to the point of corruption.
\Ticket{2934}

\item Added an \Opt{-evaluate} option to \Condor{config\_val}, which causes the configured value queried from
a given daemon to be evaluated with respect to that daemon's ClassAd.
\Ticket{856}

\item Added new capability to \Condor{submit} to allow recursive macros in
submit files. This facility allows one to update variables recursively.  An
example of a construction that works is the following: \texttt{foo = bar},
followed by \texttt{foo =  snap \$(foo)}.  Then the value of foo will be
\texttt{foo = snap bar}.  Previously, this would send \Condor{submit} into an
infinite loop of expanding the macro so that the expansion would be \texttt{foo
= snap bar bar ...}, filling up memory with copies of ``\texttt{bar}''. Note
that both left- and right- recursion works.  The construction \texttt{foo =
\$(foo) bar} by itself will not work, as it does not have an initial base case.
Mutually recursive constructions such as: \texttt{B = bar}, \texttt{C = \$(B)},
and \texttt{B= \$(C) boo} will also fill memory with expansions.
\Ticket{406}

\item Removed restriction on having macros in the "log" directive in submit
files for \Condor{dagman}
\Ticket{2428}

\item \Condor{dagman} now uses and watches, by default, only its default node
userlog for events.  DAGman now requests the schedd and shadow to write each
event to the default log, i.e., $\langle$DAG file$\rangle$.nodes.log, along
with whatever log is specified by the user.  \Condor{dagman} only writes POST
Script TERMINATE events to its default log, not to the user log. This can be
turned off by setting the configuration variable
\Macro{DAGMAN\_ALWAYS\_USE\_NODE\_LOG} to False.  In particular,
\Macro{DAGMAN\_ALWAYS\_USE\_NODE\_LOG} should be set to false if this newer
version of \Condor{dagman} is submitting jobs to an older version of
\Condor{schedd} or using an older version of \Condor{submit}
\Ticket{2807}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Configuration Variable and ClassAd Attribute Additions and Changes:

\begin{itemize}

\item New configuration variables were added to to the \Condor{schedd} to
define statistics that count subsets of jobs. These variables
have the form \Macro{SCHEDD\_COLLECT\_STATS\_BY\_XXXX} and should contain
a ClassAd expression that evaluates to a string.
XXXX\_value\_ will be prefixed to the names of attributes in the \Condor{schedd} ad
such as \Attr{XXXX\_string\_JobsStarted} which would be the count of jobs that have
started that evaluate to "value".  An optional variable of the form
\Macro{SCHEDD\_EXPIRE\_STATS\_BY\_XXXX} can be used to set an expiration time in seconds
for each set of statistics.
\Ticket{2862}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item Condor will avoid selecting down (disabled) network interfaces.  Previously Condor could select a down interface over an up (active) interface.
\Ticket{2893}

\item Made \Condor{negotiator} logic for computing submitter limits properly aware of \Macro{NEGOTIATOR\_CONSIDER\_PREEMPTION}.
\Ticket{2952}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Known Bugs:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Additions and Changes to the Manual:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}
