\section{\label{sec:History-7-9}Development Release Series 7.9}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This is the development release series of Condor.
The details of each version are described below.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-7-9-0}Version 7.9.0}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item Condor version 7.9.0 not yet released.
%\item Condor version 7.9.0 released on Month Date, 2012.

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item Added configuration variable CLASSAD\_LOG\_STRICT\_PARSING, which defaults to 
\Expr{True}, and can be used to control whether ClassAd log files such as the job queue
log are read in with strict parse checking on ClassAd expressions.
\Ticket{3069}

\item \Condor{status} now returns the schedd ad directly from the schedd daemon
if both -direct and -schedd are given on the command line.
\Ticket{2492}

\item Added status and echo command line options to \Condor{wait} command.
\Ticket{2926}

\item Changed default for USE\_PROCD setting to be true for the master.  This means that by
default the master will start a \Condor{procd} to be used by it and all other daemons on
that machine.
\Ticket{2911}

\item Added a \Expr{DEBUG} logging level output flag \Dflag{CATEGORY},
which causes Condor to include the logging level
flags in effect for each line of logged output.
\Ticket{2712}

\item \Condor{status} and \Condor{q} each have a new \Opt{-autoformat} option
to make some output format specifications easier than the existing
\Opt{-format} option.
See the \Condor{status} manual page located on page~\pageref{man-condor-status}
and the \Condor{q} manual page located on page~\pageref{man-condor-q} 
for details.
\Ticket{2941}

\item Enhanced the classad log system (e.g. the job que log) to report the record number on parse failures, 
and improved its ability to detect parse failures closer to the point of corruption.
\Ticket{2934}

\item Added an \Opt{-evaluate} option to \Condor{config\_val}, which causes the configured value queried from
a given daemon to be evaluated with respect to that daemon's ClassAd.
\Ticket{856}

\item Added code to \Condor{dagman},
such that a \Expr{VARS} assignment in a top-level DAG is applied to splices.
\Ticket{1780}

\item Condor now uses libraries from Globus 5.2.1.
\Ticket{2838}

\item When authenticating Condor daemons with GSI and
\MacroNI{GSI\_DAEMON\_NAME} is undefined, Condor checks
that the server name in the certificate matches the hostname that
the client is connecting to.  When \MacroNI{GSI\_DAEMON\_NAME} is
defined, the old behavior is preserved: only certificates matching
\MacroNI{GSI\_DAEMON\_NAME} pass the authentication step, and no
hostname check is performed.  The behavior of the hostname check
may be further controlled with the new configuration settings
\MacroNI{GSI\_SKIP\_HOST\_CHECK} and
\MacroNI{GSI\_SKIP\_HOST\_CHECK\_CERT\_REGEX}.

\item Added new capability to \Condor{submit} to allow recursive macros in
submit files. This facility allows one to update variables recursively.  An
example of a construction that works is the following: \texttt{foo = bar},
followed by \texttt{foo =  snap \$(foo)}.  Then the value of foo will be
\texttt{foo = snap bar}.  Previously, this would send \Condor{submit} into an
infinite loop of expanding the macro so that the expansion would be \texttt{foo
= snap bar bar ...}, filling up memory with copies of ``\texttt{bar}''. Note
that both left- and right- recursion works.  The construction \texttt{foo =
\$(foo) bar} by itself will not work, as it does not have an initial base case.
Mutually recursive constructions such as: \texttt{B = bar}, \texttt{C = \$(B)},
and \texttt{B= \$(C) boo} will also fill memory with expansions.
\Ticket{406}

\item Removed restriction on having macros in the "log" directive in submit
files for \Condor{dagman}
\Ticket{2428}

\item \Condor{dagman} now uses and watches, by default, only its default node
userlog for events.  DAGman now requests the schedd and shadow to write each
event to the default log, i.e., $\langle$DAG file$\rangle$.nodes.log, along
with whatever log is specified by the user.  \Condor{dagman} only writes POST
Script TERMINATE events to its default log, not to the user log. This can be
turned off by setting the configuration variable
\Macro{DAGMAN\_ALWAYS\_USE\_NODE\_LOG} to False.  In particular,
\Macro{DAGMAN\_ALWAYS\_USE\_NODE\_LOG} should be set to false if this newer
version of \Condor{dagman} is submitting jobs to an older version of
\Condor{schedd} or using an older version of \Condor{submit}
\Ticket{2807}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Configuration Variable and ClassAd Attribute Additions and Changes:

\begin{itemize}

\item There is a new configuration variable used by the \Condor{starter}.
If \Macro{STARTER\_RLIMIT\_AS} is set to an integer value, the starter
will use the setrlimit system call with the RLIMIT\_AS parameter to
limit the virtual size of each process in the user job.  The value of
this parameter is a ClassAd expression, evaluated in the context of both
the machine and job ads, where the machine ad is the "my" ad, and the job 
ad is the "target" ad.
\Ticket{1663}

\item New configuration variables were added to to the \Condor{schedd} to
define statistics that count subsets of jobs. 
These variables have the form \Macro{SCHEDD\_COLLECT\_STATS\_BY\_<Name>},
and should be defined by a ClassAd expression that evaluates to a string.
See section~\ref{param:ScheddCollectStatsByName}
for the complete definition.
The optional configuration variable of the form
\Macro{SCHEDD\_EXPIRE\_STATS\_BY\_<Name>} can be used to set an expiration time,
in seconds, for each set of statistics.
\Ticket{2862}

\item The new \SubmitCmd{batch\_queue} submit description file command
and new job ClassAd attribute \Attr{BatchQueue} specify which job
queue to use for grid universe jobs of type
\SubmitCmd{pbs}, \SubmitCmd{lsf}, and \SubmitCmd{sge}.
\Ticket{2996}

\item The new configuration macro \MacroNI{GSI\_SKIP\_HOST\_CHECK} is
a boolean setting that controls whether a check is performed during
GSI authentication of a Condor daemon.  When false (the default),
the check is not skipped, so the daemon hostname must match the
hostname in the daemon's certificate, unless otherwise exempted
by \MacroNI{GSI\_DAEMON\_NAME} or
\MacroNI{GSI\_SKIP\_HOST\_CHECK\_CERT\_REGEX}.
When true, this check is skipped, and hosts will not be rejected
due to a mismatch of certificate and hostname.

\item The new configuration macro
\MacroNI{GSI\_SKIP\_HOST\_CHECK\_CERT\_REGEX} may be set to a
regular expression.  GSI certificates of Condor daemons with a
subject name that are matched in full by this regular expression
are not required to have a matching daemon hostname and certificate
hostname.  The default is an empty regular expression, which will
not match any certificates (even if they have an empty subject name).

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item The EC2 GAHP will now respect X509\_CERT\_DIR for all (secure) connections.
\Ticket{2823}

\item Condor will avoid selecting down (disabled) network interfaces.  Previously Condor could select a down interface over an up (active) interface.
\Ticket{2893}

\item Made \Condor{negotiator} logic for computing submitter limits properly aware of \Macro{NEGOTIATOR\_CONSIDER\_PREEMPTION}.
\Ticket{2952}

\item Condor no longer back-dates file modification times by 3 minutes
when transferring job input files into the job spool directory or the job
execute directory.
\Ticket{2423}
