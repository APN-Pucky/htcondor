%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This is an Internal Use License for Condor Version 6.  This License is
to be signed by RECIPIENT (the "RECIPIENT"), and returned to the
Condor Team at the Computer Sciences Department of the University of
Wisconsin-Madison (the "PROVIDER").  The Condor Version 6 software
program was developed by the Condor Team.  All rights, title, and
interest in Condor Version 6 are owned by the Condor Team.  The
subject computer program, including source code, executables, and
documentation shall be referred to as the "SOFTWARE."

RECIPIENT and PROVIDER agree as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Definitions.
  \begin{enumerate} 
  \item The "Object Code" of the SOFTWARE means the SOFTWARE assembled
  or compiled in magnetic or electronic binary form on software media,
  which are readable and usable by machines, but not generally
  readable by humans without reverse assembly, reverse compiling, or
  reverse engineering.
  \item The "Source Code" of the SOFTWARE means the SOFTWARE written
  in programming languages, such as C and FORTRAN, including all
  comments and procedural code, such as job control language
  statements, in a form intelligible to trained programmers and
  capable of being translated into Object Code for operation on
  computer equipment through assembly or compiling, and accompanied by
  documentation, including flow charts, schematics, statements of
  principles of operations, and architecture standards, describing the
  data flows, data structures, and control logic of the SOFTWARE in
  sufficient detail to enable a trained programmer through study of
  such documentation to maintain and/or modify the SOFTWARE without
  undue experimentation.
  \item A "Derivative Work" means a work that is based on one or more
  preexisting works, such as a revision, enhancement, modification,
  translation, abridgment, condensation, expansion, or any other form
  in which such preexisting works may be recast, transformed, or
  adapted, and that, if prepared without authorization of the owner of
  the copyright in such preexisting work, would constitute a copyright
  infringement.  For purposes hereof, a Derivative Work shall also
  include any compilation that incorporates such a preexisting work.
  Unless otherwise provided in this License, all references to the
  SOFTWARE include any Derivative Works provided by PROVIDER or
  authorized to be made by RECIPIENT hereunder.
  \item "Support Materials" means documentation that describes the
  function and use of the SOFTWARE in sufficient detail to permit use
  of the SOFTWARE.  
  \end{enumerate}

\item Copying of SOFTWARE and Support Materials.  PROVIDER grants RECIPIENT
a non-exclusive, non-transferable use license to copy and distribute
internally the SOFTWARE Object Code and related Support Materials in
support of RECIPIENT's use of the SOFTWARE. 
RECIPIENT may not redistribute the SOFTWARE (electronically 
or otherwise) outside of thier own 
organization without PROVIDER's prior express authorization.

\item Use of Object Code.  PROVIDER grants RECIPIENT a royalty-free,
non-exclusive, non-transferable use license in and to the SOFTWARE, in
Object Code form only, to: 
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Install the SOFTWARE at RECIPIENT's offices listed below;
  \item Use and execute the SOFTWARE for research or other internal
  purposes only;
  \item In support of RECIPIENT's authorized use of the SOFTWARE,
  physically transfer the SOFTWARE from one (1) computer to another;
  store the SOFTWARE's machine-readable instructions or data on a
  temporary basis in main memory, extended memory, or expanded memory
  of such computer system as necessary for such use; and transmit such
  instructions or data through computers and associated devices.
  \end{enumerate}


\item Term of License.  The term of this License shall not be limited in
time.  However, should the terms of this License not be followed, the
PROVIDER may terminate this License.  All copies of the SOFTWARE, or
Derivative Works thereof, shall be destroyed by the RECIPIENT upon
termination of this License.   

\item Derivative Works.  
Any modifications
or Derivative Works based on the SOFTWARE shall be considered a part
of the SOFTWARE and therefore shall be subject to the terms of
this license.  Derivative Works may be created and used by the
RECEIPIENT, but may not be redistributed outside of the 
RECEIPIENT's organization.

\item Limitations on Use, Etc.  RECIPIENT may not use, copy, modify,
or distribute the SOFTWARE (electronically or otherwise) or any copy,
adaptation, transcription, or merged portion thereof, except as
expressly authorized in this License.  RECIPIENT's license may not
be transferred, leased, assigned, or sublicensed without PROVIDER's
prior express authorization. 

\item Data.  RECIPIENT acknowledges that data conversion is subject to
the likelihood of human and machine errors, omissions, delays, and
losses, including inadvertent loss of data or damage to media, that
may give rise to loss or damage.  PROVIDER shall not be liable for any
such errors, omissions, delays, or losses, whatsoever.  RECIPIENT is
also responsible for complying with all local, state, and federal laws
pertaining to the use and disclosure of any data.

\item The PROVIDER requests that any reports, publications, or other
disclosure of results obtained with the SOFTWARE by the RECIPIENT will
acknowledge its use by an appropriate citation.  The appropriate reference
for the SOFTWARE is "The Condor Software (Condor) was developed by the
Condor Team at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Department of Computer
Sciences."

\item Warranty Disclaimer.  RECIPIENT ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT:
(A) NEITHER THE CONDOR TEAM NOR THE BOARD OF REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY
OF WISCONSIN SYSTEM (REGENTS) MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES
WHATSOEVER ABOUT THE SUITABILITY OF THE SOFTWARE FOR ANY PURPOSE; (B)
THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS, WITH ALL DEFECTS" BASIS WITHOUT
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY
AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NONINFRINGEMENT; (C) NEITHER
THE CONDOR TEAM NOR THE REGENTS SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGE OR LOSS
OF ANY KIND ARISING OUT OF OR RESULTING FROM RECIPIENT'S POSSESSION
OR USE OF THE SOFTWARE (INCLUDING DATA LOSS OR CORRUPTION), REGARDLESS
OF WHETHER SUCH LIABILITY IS BASED IN TORT, CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE;
AND (D) NEITHER THE CONDOR TEAM NOR THE REGENTS HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO
PROVIDE DEBUGGING, MAINTENANCE, SUPPORT, UPDATES, ENHANCEMENTS, OR
MODIFICATIONS.

\item Damages Disclaimer.  RECIPIENT ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT IN
NO EVENT WILL THE CONDOR TEAM OR THE REGENTS BE LIABLE TO RECIPIENT
FOR ANY SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT OR SIMILAR DAMAGES, INCLUDING
ANY LOST PROFITS OR LOST DATA ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO
USE THE SOFTWARE EVEN IF THE CONDOR TEAM OR THE REGENTS HAVE BEEN
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

\item Compliance with Applicable Laws.  RECIPIENT agrees to abide by
copyright law and all other applicable laws of the United States
including, but not limited to, export control laws.

\item U.S. Government Rights Restrictions.  Use, duplication, or
disclosure by the U.S. Government is subject to restrictions as set
forth in subparagraph (c)(1)(ii) of The Rights in Technical Data and
Computer Software clause at DFARS 252.227-7013 or subparagraphs (c)(1)
and (2) of Commercial Computer Software-Restricted Rights at 48 CFR
52.227-19, as applicable, Condor Team, Attention: Professor Miron
Livny, 7367 Computer Sciences, 1210 W. Dayton St., Madison, WI
53706-1685, (608) 262-0856 or miron@cs.wisc.edu.

\item Governing Law.  This License shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Wisconsin as it applies to a contract made and performed in such state, except to the extent such laws are in conflict with federal law.

\item Modifications and Waivers.  This License may not be modified
except by a writing signed by authorized representatives of both
parties.  A waiver by either party of its rights hereunder shall not
be binding unless contained in a writing signed by an authorized
representative of the party waiving its rights.  The nonenforcement or
waiver of any provision on one (1) occasion shall not constitute a
waiver of such provision on any other occasions unless expressly so
agreed in writing.  It is agreed that no use of trade or other regular
practice or method of dealing between the parties hereto shall be used
to modify, interpret, supplement, or alter in any manner the terms of
this License.
