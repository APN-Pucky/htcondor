\index{logging|(}
HTCondor records many types of information in a variety of logs.
Administration may require locating and using the
contents of a log to debug issues.
Listed here are details of the logs, to aid in identification.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{\label{sec:job-systemlogs}Job and Daemon Logs}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{description}
\item[job event log]
  The job event log is an optional, chronological list of events that occur
  as a job runs.
  The submit description file for the job requests a job event log with
  the submit command \SubmitCmd{log}.
  The log is created and remains on the submit machine.
  Contents of the log are detailed in section~\ref{sec:job-log-events}.
  Examples of events are that the job is running,
  that the job  is placed on hold, or that the job completed.
\item[daemon logs]
\item[job queue log]
  A representation of the current job queue. 
  The file name is set by configuration variable \Macro{JOB\_QUEUE\_LOG},
  and defaults to \File{\$(SPOOL)/job\_queue.log}.
  Configuration variables that affect the job queue log are 
  \begin{description}
  \item [\Macro{SCHEDD\_BACKUP\_SPOOL}] 
  \item [\Macro{ROTATE\_HISTORY\_DAILY}] 
  \item [\Macro{ROTATE\_HISTORY\_MONTHLY}] 
  \end{description}
\item[\Condor{schedd} audit log]
  Configuration variables that affect the audit log are 
  \begin{description}
  \item [\Macro{SCHEDD\_AUDIT\_LOG}] 
  \item [\Macro{MAX\_SCHEDD\_AUDIT\_LOG}] 
  \item [\Macro{MAX\_NUM\_SCHEDD\_AUDIT\_LOG}] 
  \end{description}
\item[event log]
  The event log is an optional, chronological list of events that occur
  for all jobs and all users.
  The events logged are the same as those that would go into a job event
  log.
  The file name is set by configuration variable \Macro{EVENT\_LOG}.
  The log is created only if this configuration variable is set.

  Configuration variables that affect the event log, 
  setting details such as
  the maximum size to which this log may grow and details of file rotation
  and locking are
  \begin{description}
  \item [\Macro{EVENT\_LOG\_MAX\_SIZE}] 
  \item [\Macro{EVENT\_LOG\_MAX\_ROTATIONS}]
  \item [\Macro{EVENT\_LOG\_LOCKING}]
  \item [\Macro{EVENT\_LOG\_FSYNC}]
  \item [\Macro{EVENT\_LOG\_ROTATION\_LOCK}]
  \item [\Macro{EVENT\_LOG\_JOB\_AD\_INFORMATION\_ATTRS}]
  \item [\Macro{EVENT\_LOG\_USE\_XML}]
  \end{description}
