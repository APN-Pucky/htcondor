\section{Obtaining Condor Distributions}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Where can I download Condor?

Condor can be downloaded from \Url{http://www.cs.wisc.edu/downloads/} or from
\Url{http://www.bo.infn.it/condor-mirr/downloads/}.

\item If I try to download Condor, it sends me back to the downloads page!

If you are try to download Condor with a "junk-busting" web-proxy, try disabling it.
We follow the path you take through our download menus, and sometimes these proxies strip off necessary information.

\item Do you have any website mirrors?

Yes.  We have our main site at \Url{http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/}
which is located in Madison, Wisconsin, USA.  We also operate a mirror
site at the Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare in Bologna, Italy
at \Url{http://www.bo.infn.it/condor-mirr/}.  Currently we have the 
binary distrubations of Condor and the Condor Manual available on the
mirror site.

\item What platforms do you support?

See Section~\ref{sec:Availability}, on page~\pageref{sec:Availability}.

\item Do you distribute source code?

At this time we do \Bold{not} distribute source code.
Even so, if you need the source code, email us at \Email{condor-admin@cs.wisc.edu} and tell us why.

\item What is Personal Condor?

Personal Condor is a term used for a specific style of installing Condor.
A Personal Condor is a one-machine pool.  When you use flocking to bind
them together, its simular to a normal Condor pool, except that you are restricted
to "standard" jobs, and you are running additional \condor{collector} and \condor{negotiator} 
daemons.

\item Do you support submitting to Globus?

Yes, we do.  At this time, however, we have not released it (yet!)

\end{enumerate}


\section{Setting up Condor}

\begin{enumerate}

\item How do I get more than one job to run on my SMP machine?

Starting with Condor version 6.1, Condor will recognize a SMP machine and advertise each CPU of the
machine seperately.  For more details, see section~\ref{sec:Configuring-SMP} on page~\pageref{sec:Configuring-SMP}.

Support for SMP machines in Condor Version 6.0 is available as a contrib module from the download site.

\item How do I configure Condor to only run my jobs at certain times of the day?


\end{enumerate}

\section{Running Condor Jobs}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{I'm at the University of Wisconsin -- Madison, Computer Science department, and I am having problems!}

First, please read the webpage \Url{http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/uwcs.html} before proceeding!
Specifically, your home directory is in AFS, which causes Condor some specific problems.
The above URL will contain the way to fix things here at UWCS.

\item{I'm getting a lot of email from Condor, should I just delete all of it?}

Generally you shouldn't ignore all of the mail Condor sends.  Often, Condor will
be sending legitimate email.  To reduce the email that a job will send you, see

\Todo


\item Why do my vanilla jobs only run on the machine where I submitted them from?

\Todo

\item How do I configure my pool to run vanilla jobs or to use a "clipped" port of Condor?

\Todo

\item Why won't my jobs run at all?

\Todo

\end{enumerate}

\section{Troubleshooting}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{What happens if the central manager crashes?} 

If the central manager crashes, all running jobs will continue to
run. All queued jobs will simply remain in the queues until the central
manager comes up and begins matchmaking again.  Nothing special needs
to be done when the cenrtal manager is brought back online. 

\end{enumerate}
