\Synopsis \SynProg{\Condor{checkpoint\_job}}

\Description

\Condor{checkpoint\_job} preforms a periodic checkpoint on a job running on
the local machine.  This job will not be
stopped due to this process.  In order to vacate the jobs from the machine see
\Condor{vacate} If there are no jobs running on the local machine, or the job
running is in the vanilla universe,
\Condor{checkpoint\_job} has no effect. This command is a more specific version
of the the generic \Condor{checkpoint} command.  Users and administrators
shouldn't have to use this command in a properly working condor pool,
since the condor daemons take care of job checkpointing automatically.
