\Description
\Condor{q} displays information about jobs in the local condor job queue.
If a \Arg{cluster} and a \Arg{process} are both specified, \Condor{q}
displays information about the specified process. If a \Arg{cluster} is
specified without a \Arg{process}, \Condor{q} displays information about
all processes belonging to the specified cluster. With no arguments
\Condor{q} displays information about all condor jobs in the local queue.
\Condor{q} displays a one line summary of information about specified
processes as follows:

\begin{description}
\item[ID] The cluster/process id of the condor job. 
\item[OWNER] The owner of the job. 
\item[SUBMITTED] The month, day, hour, and minute the job was submitted to the queue. 
\item[CPU\_USAGE] Remote CPU time accumulated by the job to date in days, hours, minutes, and seconds.
If the job is currently running, time accumulated during the current run is not shown. 
\item[ST] Current status of the job. U = unexpanded (never been run), R = running, I = idle (waiting for a machine to execute
     on), C = completed, and X = removed. 
\item[PRI] User specified priority of the job, ranges from -20 to +20, with higher numbers corresponding to greater priority. 
\item[SIZE] The virtual image size of the executable in megabytes. 
\item[CMD] The name of the executable.
