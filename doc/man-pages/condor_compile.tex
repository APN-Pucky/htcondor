\Description
Use \Condor{compile} relink a program with the Condor libraries for submission into Condor's Standard Universe. The
Condor libraries provide the program with additional support, such as the capability to checkpoint, which is required in
Condor's Standard Universe mode of operation. \Condor{compile} requires access to the source or object code of the
program to be submitted; if source or object code for the program is not available (i.e. only an executable binary, or if it is a
shell script), then the program must submitted into Condor's Vanilla Universe. See the reference page for \Condor{submit}
and/or consult the "Condor Users and Administrators Manual" for further information. 

To use \Condor{compile}, simply enter "condor\_compile" followed by whatever you would normally enter to compile or link
your application. Any resulting executables will have the Condor libraries linked in. For example: 

condor\_compile cc -O -o myprogram.condor file1.c file2.c ... 

will produce a binary "myprogram.condor" which is relinked for Condor, capable of
checkpoint/migration/remote-system-calls, and ready to submit to the Standard Universe. 

If the Condor administrator has opted to fully install \Condor{compile}, then \Condor{compile} can be followed by practically any
command or program, including make or shell-script programs. For example, the following would all work: 

condor\_compile make 

condor\_compile make install 

condor\_compile f77 -O mysolver.f 

condor\_compile /bin/csh compile-me-shellscript 

If the Condor administrator has opted to only do a partial install of \Condor{compile}, the you are restricted to following
\Condor{compile} with one of the following programs: 

     cc (the system C compiler) 

     acc (ANSI C compiler, on Sun systems) 

     c89 (POSIX compliant C compiler, on some systems) 

     CC (the system C++ compiler) 

     f77 (the system FORTRAN compiler) 

     gcc (the GNU C compiler) 

     g++ (the GNU C++ compiler) 

     g77 (the GNU FORTRAN compiler) 

     ld (the system linker) 

Note that if you use explicitly call "ld" when you normally create your binary, simply use "condor\_compile ld <ld arguments
and options>" instead.
