\Description 

\Condor{fetchlog} will contact Condor running on a machine and ask it
to return a log file from that machine. This can simplify your life by
not requiring you to log into the machine to get that log file. 

For security purposes (authentication and authorization), this command
requires an administrator's level of access. See section~\ref{sec:Config-Security} 
on page~\pageref{sec:Config-Security} for more details about Condor's
security mechanisms.

\begin{Options}
	\ToolArgsBaseDesc
    \OptItem{\OptArg{-pool}{centralmanagerhostname[:portnumber]}}{Specify a pool by giving the
	central manager's hostname and an optional port number}
	\ToolArgsAffectDesc
    \OptItem{log file name}{Which log to get. It should be the name
    you see in the condor\_config file, without the \_LOG. For
    COLLECTOR\_LOG, it is collector. Currently, this means you can
    specify MASTER, COLLECTOR, NEGOTIATOR, NEGOTIATOR\_MATCH, SCHEDD,
    SHADOW, STARTD, or STARTER. }
\end{Options}

\ExitStatus
\Condor{fetchlog} will exit with a status value of 0 (zero) upon success,
and it will exit with the value 1 (one) upon failure.

\Examples
To get the condor\_negotiator's log from a host named head.example.com
in your current pool:
\begin{verbatim}
condor_fetchlog head.example.com NEGOTIATOR
\end{verbatim}

To get the condor\_startd's log from a host named execute.example.com
in your current pool:
\begin{verbatim}
condor_fetchlog execute.example.com STARTD
\end{verbatim}

This command requested the condor\_startd's log from the
condor\_master. However, in extreme circumstances, the condor\_master
may have crashed or be unresponsive, so you can ask another daemon
running on that computer to return the log. For instance, you can ask
the condor\_startd to return it's log:

\begin{verbatim}
condor_fetchlog -startd execute.example.com STARTD
\end{verbatim}
