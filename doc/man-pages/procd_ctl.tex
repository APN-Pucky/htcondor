\Description 

This is a programmatic interface to the \Condor{procd} daemon. It may be
used to track new process families, send signals to 

This is a program only available for the Linux ports of Condor.

\begin{Options}

	\OptItem{\Opt{-h}}{Print out usage information.}
	
	\OptItem{\OptArg{-A}{address-file}}{The path to the address file
		which is the named pipe clients must use to speak with the
		\Condor{procd}.}

	These are the available commands.

	\OptItem{\Opt{TRACK\_BY\_ASSOCIATED\_GID} \Arg{gid} \oArg{pid}}
		{Use the specified gid to track the specified family rooted at pid.}

	\OptItem{\Opt{GET\_USAGE} \oArg{pid}}
		{Get the total usage information about the pid family at pid.}

	\OptItem{\Opt{DUMP} \oArg{pid}}
		{Print out information about the root pid being watched and information
		about the tree of process under the root pid.}

	\OptItem{\Opt{LIST} \oArg{pid}}
		{Print out information about all the watched processes.}

	\OptItem{\Opt{SIGNAL\_PROCESS} \Arg{signal} \oArg{pid}}
		{Send the signal to the process at the specified pid.}

	\OptItem{\Opt{SUSPEND\_FAMILY} \Arg{pid}}
		{Suspend the process family rooted at pid.}

	\OptItem{\Opt{CONTINUE\_FAMILY} \Arg{pid}}
		{Suspend the process family rooted at pid.}

	\OptItem{\Opt{KILL\_FAMILY} \Arg{pid}}
		{Kill the process family rooted at pid.}

	\OptItem{\Opt{UNREGISTER\_FAMILY} \Arg{pid}}
		{Stop tracking the process family rooted at pid.}

	\OptItem{\Opt{SNAPSHOT}}
		{Perform a snapshot of the tracked family tree.}

	\OptItem{\Opt{QUIT}}
		{Disconnect from the \Condor{procd} and exit.}

\end{Options}
	

\GenRem

This program may be used in a standalone mode, independent of
Condor, to track process families. The programs \Prog{procd\_ctl} and
\Prog{gidd\_alloc} are used with the \Condor{procd} in standalone mode
to interact with the daemon and inquire about certain state of running
processes on the machine, respectively.

\ExitStatus

\Prog{procd\_ctl} will exit with a status value of 0 (zero) upon success,
and it will exit with the value 1 (one) upon failure.
