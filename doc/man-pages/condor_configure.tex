% 2 hyphens in a row, without any spaces inbetween poses a problem
% for LaTeX.  Things tried, without success.
%   --      results in a single hyphen
%   - -     results in a 2 hyphens, with too much space inbetween
%   -\--    results in a 2 hyphens, with too much space inbetween
%  $--$     results in 2 long, very high up dashes, with nice spacing
%  $-$$-$   results in 2 long, very high up dashes, with too much spacing

% Alain's fix
%   {\tt--}          makes one nice dash in html
%                    makes 2 nice dashes in postscript
%   {\tt--}{\tt--}   makes 2 nice dashes that collide with following letter
%                       in html
%                    makes 4  nice dashes in postscript
%   {\small{\tt--}}{\small{\tt--}}  2 nice dashes in html
%                                   4 nice dashes in postscript

% Peter's fix
%   ---            makes 2 dashes exactly as required in the html
%                  makes 1 very long dash in postscript

% Karen's final fix:  do everything manually (no LaTeX macros),
%  and use the verbatim.

\Description 

\Condor{configure} is a Perl script that installs and/or configures
Condor.
It will run with Perl 5 or more recent versions.

\Condor{configure} is designed to be run more than one time
where required.
It can install Condor (with a correct configuration),
or it can change the configuration files.
Note that changes in the configuration files do not result
in changes while Condor is running.
To effect changes while Condor is running,
it is necessary to further do \Condor{reconfig} or \Condor{restart}.
\Condor{reconfig}  is required where the currently executing
daemons need to be informed of configuration changes.
\Condor{restart} is required where the options
\verb@--@\textbf{make-personal-condor} or
\verb@--@\textbf{type}
are used, since these affect which daemons are running.

Running \Condor{configure} with no options results in the
help screen being printed.

\begin{Options}
	\OptItem{\Opt{---help}} {Print help screen and exit}
	\OptItem{\Opt{---version}} {Print Condor version number and exit}
	\OptItem{\Opt{---install}} {Perform installation, assuming that
	the current working directory contains the \File{release.tar}
	file.  Without further options, the configuration is that of
	a Personal Condor.  If used as an upgrade within an existing
	installation directory, existing configuration files and local
	directory are preserved.}
	\OptItem{\Opt{---install-dir=$<$path$>$}} {Provides the path to the
	directory for the installation.  The default is the current
	working directory.  When \Condor{configure} is not used to
	install Condor, this command-line argument provides the path
	to the directory containing the configuration files.}
	\OptItem{\Opt{---local-dir=$<$path$>$}} {Specifies the
	location of the \MacroUNI{LOCAL} directory}
	\OptItem{\Opt{---make-personal-condor}} {Installs and configures
	for Personal Condor (a 1-node pool running on a local machine)}
	\OptItem{\Opt{---type= $<$ submit, execute, manager $>$}} {One
	or more of the types may be listed.
	This determines the roles that a machine may play.
	All roles are played by a Personal Condor installation.}
	\OptItem{\Opt{---central-manager=$<$hostname$>$}} {Modifies
	the configuration variables \MacroNI{COLLECTOR\_HOST}
	and \MacroNI{NEGOTIATOR\_HOST} to be the given host name.}
	\OptItem{\Opt{---owner=$<$ownername$>$}} {Set configuration
	such that Condor daemons will be executed as the given owner.
	This is only applicable when \Condor{configure} is run by root.
	If not run as root,
	use the owner is the user running the \Condor{configure} command.
	}
	\OptItem{\Opt{---verbose}} {Print information about changes
	to configuration variables as they occur.}
\end{Options}

\ExitStatus

\Condor{configure} will exit with a status value of 0 (zero) upon success,
and it will exit with a nonzero value upon failure.

\Examples
To install Condor on the machine that is to be the pool's central manager:
\begin{verbatim}
% condor_configure --install --type = submit, execute, manager
\end{verbatim}
This assumes that the current working directory contains the
file \File{release.tar}, and it also assumes that this machine
may be used to both submit and execute Condor jobs.

To change the location of the \MacroUNI{LOCAL} directory
in the configuration file, use the following format for
the \Condor{configure} command:
\begin{verbatim}
% condor_configure --local-dir = /path/to/local/directory
\end{verbatim}
