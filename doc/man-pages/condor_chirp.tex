\Description 
\Condor{chirp} when run from a user job on an execute machine, access
files or job classad attributes on the submit machine.  Files can be
read, written or removed.  Job attributes can be read, and most
attributes can be updated.  If the input file name for put is a dash,
\Condor{chirp} uses standard input as the source.  If the output file
name for fetch is a dash, \Condor{chirp} writes to standard output
instead of a local file.

Jobs that use \Condor{chirp} must have the attribute
+WantIOProxy=true set in the job ad. \Condor{chirp} only works in the
Vanilla, MPI, Parallel and Java Universes.

\begin{Options}
  \OptItem{\Opt{-help}}{Display usage information and exit.}
  \OptItem{fetch remoteFile localFile}{Copy the remoteFile from the submit machine to the execute machine.}
  \OptItem{remove remoteFile}{Remove the remote file from the submit machine.}
  \OptItem{put \Opt{-mode mode} -\Opt{perm perm} localFile remoteFile}{Copy the localFile from the execute machine to the submit machine.  Perm is the unix permission to open the file with.}
\end{Options}

Mode is \begin{itemize}
\item w - open for writing
\item a - force all writes to append
\item t - truncate before use
\item c - create if it doesn't exist
\item x - fail if 'c' is given and the file already exists
\end{itemize}



\Examples

To copy a file from the submit machine to the execute machine while the 
user job is running, run

\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
% condor_chirp fetch remotefile localfile
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

To print to standard output the value of the Requirements expression from 
within a running job, run

\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
% condor_chirp get_job_attr Requirements
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

Note that the remote (e.g. submit) directory path is relative to the
submit directory, and the local (e.g. execute) directory is relative to the
current directory of the running program.

To append the word foo to a file on the submit machine, run

\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
% echo foo | condor_chirp put -mode wat - RemoteFile
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize


\ExitStatus

\Condor{chirp} will exit with a status value of 0 (zero) upon success,
and it will exit with the value 1 (one) upon failure.
