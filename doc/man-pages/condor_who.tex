\Description
\Condor{who} queries and displays information about the user that
owns the jobs running on a machine.
It is intended to be run on an execute machine.

The options that may be supplied to \Condor{who} belong to five groups:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Help options} provide information about the \Condor{who}
  tool.
  \item \textbf{Address options} allow destination specification for query.
  \item \textbf{Display options} control the formatting and which of the 
  queried information to display.
\end{itemize}

At any time, only one \textbf{help option} and one \textbf{address option}
may be specified.  
Any number of \textbf{display options} may be specified.

\begin{Options}
    \OptItem{\Opt{-help}}{(help option) Display usage information}
    \OptItem{\Opt{-diagnostic}}{(help option) Display extra information helpful for debugging }
    \OptItem{\Opt{-verbose}}{(help option) Display PIDs and 
addresses of daemons }
    \OptItem{\OptArg{-address}{hostaddress}} {(address option) 
      Identify the \Condor{startd} host address to query }
    \OptItem{\OptArg{-logdir}{directoryname}} {(address option) 
      Specifies the log directory that \Condor{who} will scan to search
      for command ports of \Condor{start} daemons to query }

    \OptItem{\Opt{-long}}{(display option) Display entire ClassAds }
    \OptItem{\Opt{-wide}}{(display option) Displays fields without
truncating them in order to fit screen width }

\OptItem{\OptArg{-format}{fmt attr}}{(display option) Display attribute
      \Arg{attr} in format \Arg{fmt}.
      To display the attribute or expression the format must contain a single
      \Code{printf(3)}-style conversion specifier.
      Attributes must be from the resource ClassAd.
      Expressions are ClassAd expressions and may
      refer to attributes in the resource ClassAd.
      If the attribute is not present in a given ClassAd and cannot
      be parsed as an expression, then the
      format option will be silently skipped.
      The conversion specifier must match the type of the
      attribute or expression.
      \%s is suitable for strings such as \Attr{Name},
      \%d for integers such as \Attr{LastHeardFrom},
      and \%f for floating point numbers such as \Attr{LoadAvg}.
      \%v identifies the type of the attribute,
      and then prints the value in an appropriate format.
      \%V identifies the type of the attribute,
      and then prints the value in an appropriate format as it would
      appear in the \Opt{-long} format.
      As an example, strings used with \%V will have quote marks.
      An incorrect format will result in undefined behavior.
      Do not use more than one conversion specifier in a given
      format.  More than one conversion specifier will result
      in undefined behavior.  To output multiple attributes
      repeat the \Opt{-format} option once for each desired
      attribute.
      Like \Code{printf(3)}-style formats, one may include other
      text that will be reproduced directly.
      A format without any conversion specifiers may be specified,
      but an attribute is still required.
      Include \Bs n to specify a line break. }
    \OptItem{\OptArg{-autoformat[:tn,lVh]}{attr1 [attr2 ...]}} {
      (display option) Display machine ClassAd attribute values 
      formatted in a default way according to their attribute types.  
      This option takes an arbitrary number of attribute names as arguments,
      and prints out their values.  It is like the \Opt{-format} option,
      but no format strings are required.
      It is assumed that no attribute names begin with a dash character,
      so that the next word that begins with dash is the 
      start of the next option.
      The \Opt{autoformat} option may be followed by a colon character
      and formatting qualifiers:

      \textbf{t} add a tab character before each field instead of 
      the default space character,

      \textbf{n} add a newline character after each field,

      \textbf{,} add a comma character after each field,

      \textbf{l} label each field,

      \textbf{V} use \%V rather than \%v for formatting,

      \textbf{h} print headings before the first line of output.

      The newline and comma characters may \emph{not} be used together.
      }
\end{Options}

and it will exit with the value 1 (one) upon failure.
