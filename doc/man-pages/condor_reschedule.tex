\Description 

\Condor{reschedule} updates the information about a given machines resources
and jobs to the central manager.  This can be used if one wants to see the
current status of a machine.  In order to do this, one would first run
\Condor{reschedule}, and then use the \Condor{status} command to get 
specific information about that machine.  \Condor{reschedule} also
starts a new negotiation cycle between resource owners and resource providers
on the central managers, so that jobs can be matched with machines right
away.  This can be useful in situations where the time between negotiation
cycles is somewhat long, and an administrator wants to see if a job they have
in the queue will get matched without waiting for the next negotiation cycle.
