\Description 

\Condor{procd} tracks and manages process families on behalf of the
Condor daemons. 
It may track families of PIDs via relationships such
as: direct parent/child, environment variables, uid, and supplementary
group ids.  
Management of the pid families include 
\begin{itemize}
\item registering new families or new members of existing families
\item getting usage information
\item signaling families for operations such as suspension, 
continuing, or killing the family 
\item getting a snapshot of the tree of families 
\end{itemize}
In a regular Condor installation, 
this program is not intended to be used or executed by any human.

The required
\OptArg{-A}{address-file}
argument is the path to the address file which is the named pipe
that clients must use to speak with the \Condor{procd}.
	
\begin{Options}

  \OptItem{\Opt{-h}}{Print out usage information.}
	
  \OptItem{\Opt{-D}}{Wait for the debugger. Initially sleep 30
  seconds before beginning normal function.}

  \OptItem{\OptArg{-C}{principal}}{The UID of the owner of the named
  pipe that clients must use to speak to the \Condor{procd}.}
	
  \OptItem{\OptArg{-L}{log-file}}{A file the \Condor{procd} will
  use to write logging information.}
	
  \OptItem{\Opt{-E}}{This determines if the \Condor{procd} will allocate the
  GID associated with a process by itself (not specified), or if
  by another tool such as the \Prog{procd\_ctl} tool must perform
  the association (is specified). The default is the \Condor{procd} will
  allocate the gid by itself.}

  \OptItem{\OptArg{-P}{PID}}{If not specified, the \Condor{procd} will 
  use the \Condor{procd}'s parent, which may not be PID 1 on UNIX,
  as the parent of the \Condor{procd} and the root of the tracking
  family. When not specified, if the \Condor{procd}'s parent PID
  dies, the \Condor{procd} exits. When specified, the \Condor{procd} will
  track the PID family in question and not also exit if
  the PID exits.}

  \OptItem{\OptArg{-S}{seconds}}{The maximum number of seconds the 
  \Condor{procd} will wait between taking snapshots
  of the tree of families. Different clients to the
  \Condor{procd} can specify different snapshot times. The
  quickest snapshot time is the one performed by the
  \Condor{procd}. When this option is not specified, a default value
  of 60 seconds is used.}

  \OptItem{\OptArg{-G}{min-gid max-gid}}{If -E is NOT specified, then
  track process families using a self-allocated free GID out of the
  range specified. This means if a new process shows up using a
  previously known GID, it will automatically associate into the
  process family assigned that GID. If -E IS specified, then
  instead of self-allocating the GID, the \Prog{procd\_ctl} tool must be
  used to associate the GID with the pid root of the family. The
  associated GID must still be in the range specified. This is a
  Linux only feature.}
		
  \OptItem{\OptArg{-K}{windows-softkill-binary}}{This is the path to the
  \Prog{condor\_softkill.exe} binary. It is used to send softkill
  signals to process families. This is a Windows only feature.}

  \OptItem{\OptArg{-I}{glexec-kill-path glexec-path}}{Specify the
  binary used to send a signal to a PID and the \Prog{glexec} binary 
  itself which will execute the first binary under the right 
  privileges to send the signal.}
	
\end{Options}

\GenRem

This program may be used in a stand alone mode, independent of
Condor, to track process families. The programs \Prog{procd\_ctl} and
\Prog{gidd\_alloc} are used with the \Condor{procd} in stand alone mode
to interact with the daemon and to inquire about certain state of running
processes on the machine, respectively.

\ExitStatus

\Condor{procd} will exit with a status value of 0 (zero) upon success,
and it will exit with the value 1 (one) upon failure.
