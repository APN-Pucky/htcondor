\Description 

\Condor{procd} tracks and manages process families on behalf of the
Condor daemons. It may track families of pids via relationships such
as: direct parent/child, environment variables, uid, and supplementary
group ids.  Management of the pid families include: registering new
families or new members of existing families, getting usage information,
signaling families for operations such as suspension, continuing, killing
the family, and getting a snapshot of the tree of families. In a regular
Condor installation, this program is not intended to be used or executed
by any human.

\begin{Options}

	\OptItem{\Opt{-h}}{Print out usage information.}
	
	\OptItem{\Opt{-D}}{Wait for the debugger. Initially sleep 30
		seconds before beginning normal function.}

	\OptItem{\OptArg{-A}{address-file}}{The path to the address file
		which is the named pipe clients must use to speak with the
		\Condor{procd}.}
	
	\OptItem{\OptArg{-C}{principal}}{The UID of the owner of the named
		pipe that clients must use to speak to the \Condor{procd}.}
	
	\OptItem{\OptArg{-L}{log-file}}{A file the \Condor{procd} will
		use to write logging information.}
	
	\OptItem{\Opt{-E}}{This determines if the \Condor{procd} will allocate the
		gid associated with a process by itself (not specified), or if
		by another tool such as the \Prog{procd\_ctl} tool must perform
		the association (is specified). The default is the procd will
		allocate the gid by itself.}

	\OptItem{\OptArg{-P}{pid}}{If not specified, the \Condor{procd} will 
		use the \Condor{procd}'s parent, which may not be pid 1 on UNIX,
		as the parent of the \Condor{procd} and the root of the tracking
		family. When not specified, if the \Condor{procd}'s parent pid
		dies, the \Condor{procd} exits. When specified, the \Condor{procd} will
		track the pid family in question and not also exit if
		the pid exits.}

	\OptItem{\OptArg{-S}{seconds}}{The maximum number of seconds the 
		\Condor{procd} will wait in between taking snapshots
		of the tree of families. Different clients to the
		\Condor{Procd} can specify different snapshot times. The
		quickest snapshot time is the one performed by the
		\Condor{procd}. The default is 60 seconds.}

	
	\OptItem{\OptArg{-G}{min-gid max-gid}}{If -E is NOT specified, then
		track process families using a self-allocated free gid out of the
		range specified. This means if a new process shows up using a
		previously known gid, it will automatically associate into the
		process family assigned that gid. If -E IS specified, then
		instead of self-allocating the gid, the \Prog{procd\_ctl} tool must be
		used to associate the gid with the pid root of the family. The
		associated gid must still be in the range specified. This is a
		Linux only feature.}
		
	\OptItem{\OptArg{-K}{windows-softkill-binary}}{This is the path to the
		\Prog{condor\_softkill.exe} binary. It is used to send softkill
		signals to process families. This is a windows only feature.}

	\OptItem{\OptArg{-I}{glexec-kill-path glexec-path}}{Specify the
		binary used to send a signal to a pid and the glexec binary 
		itself which will execute the first binary under the right 
		privileges to send the signal.}
	
\end{Options}

\GenRem

This program may be used in a standalone mode, independent of
Condor, to track process families. The programs \Prog{procd\_ctl} and
\Prog{gidd\_alloc} are used with the \Condor{procd} in standalone mode
to interact with the daemon and inquire about certain state of running
processes on the machine, respectively.

\ExitStatus

\Condor{procd} will exit with a status value of 0 (zero) upon success,
and it will exit with the value 1 (one) upon failure.
