\Description 

This program will scan the alive pids looking for which GID is unused in
in the supplied range. Upon finding one it will add it to its own supplementary
group list and then scan the pids again expecting to find only itself using
the GID. If no collision has occurred, the program exists, otherwise it
retries.

\begin{Options}

	\OptItem{\Opt{min-gid max-gid}}{
		The minimum and maximum gids out of which one is allocated if 
		possible.}
	
\end{Options}
	
\GenRem

This is a program only available for the Linux ports of Condor.

\ExitStatus

\Prog{gidd\_alloc} will exit with a status value of 0 (zero) upon success,
and it will exit with the value 1 (one) upon failure.
