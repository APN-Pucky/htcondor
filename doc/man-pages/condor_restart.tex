\Description 

\Condor{restart} restarts any specified Condor daemon on the local
machine, or all the machines specified in the hostname list.  If, for
example, the \Condor{master} needs to be restarted again with
a fresh state, this is the command that should be used to do so.
Also, if the DAEMON\_LIST variable in the condor configuration file has
been changed, one must restart the \Condor{master} in order to see these
changes.  A simple \Condor{reconfigure} is not enough in this situation.
\Condor{restart} will safely shut down all running jobs and all submitted
jobs from the machine being restarted, shutdown all the child daemons
of the \Condor{master}, and restart the \Condor{master}.
