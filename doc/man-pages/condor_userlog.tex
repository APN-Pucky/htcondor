\Description
\Condor{userlog} parses the information in job log files and displays
summaries for each workstation allocation and for each job.  See the
manual page for \Condor{submit} on page~\pageref{man-condor-submit} for
instructions for specifying that Condor write a log file for your
jobs.

If \Opt{-total} is not specified, \Condor{userlog} will first display
a record for each workstation allocation, which includes the following
information:

\begin{description}
\item[Job] The cluster/process id of the Condor job.
\item[Host] The host where the job ran.  By default, the host's IP
address is displayed.  If \Opt{-hostname} is specified, the hostname
will be displayed instead.
\item[Evict Time] The Unix time (see the time(2) Unix man page) when
the job was evicted from the host.
\item[Wall Time] The number of seconds for which this workstation was
allocated to the job.
\item[Good Time] The number of seconds of the allocation which
contributed to the completion of this job.  If the job exited during
the allocation, then this value will equal ``Wall Time.''  If the job
performed a checkpoint, then the value equals the work saved in
the checkpoint during this allocation.  If the job did not exit or
perform a checkpoint during this allocation, the value will be 0.
This value can be greater than 0 and less than ``Wall Time'' if the
application completed a periodic checkpoint during the allocation but
failed to checkpoint when evicted.
\item[CPU Usage] The CPU time (seconds) which contributed to the completion of
this job.
\item[Start] The hour [0-23] when the allocation began.
\item[End] The hour [0-23] when the allocation ended.
\item[Day] The day of the week [0-6] when the allocation ended.
Sunday is represented by 0 and Saturday is represented by 6.
\end{description}

\Condor{userlog} will then display summary statistics per host:

\begin{description}
\item[Host/Job] The IP address or hostname for the host.
\item[Wall Time] The number of hours of workstation time allocated by
this host to the jobs specified in the query.  By default, all jobs in
the log are included in the query.
\item[Good Time] The number of hours allocated on this host which
contributed to the completion of the jobs specified in the query.
\item[CPU Usage] The CPU time (hours) obtained from this host which
contributed to the completion of the jobs specified in the query.
\item[Avg Alloc] The average length of an allocation on this host in minutes.
\item[Avg Lost] The average number of minutes of work lost when a job
was evicted from this host without successfully performing a checkpoint.
\item[Goodput] This percentage is computed as Good Time divided by
Wall Time.
\item[Util.] This percentage is computed as CPU Usage divided by Good
Time.
\end{description}

\Condor{userlog} will then display summary statistics per job:

\begin{description}
\item[Host/Job] The cluster/process id of the Condor job.
\item[Wall Time] The total number of hours of workstation time allocated to
this job.
\item[Good Time] The total number of hours allocated to this job which
contributed to the job's completion.
\item[CPU Usage] The total CPU time (hours) which contributed to this
job's completion.
\item[Avg Alloc] The average length of a workstation allocation
obtained by this job in minutes.
\item[Avg Lost] The average number of minutes of work lost when this job
was evicted from a host without successfully performing a checkpoint.
\item[Goodput] This percentage is computed as Good Time divided by
Wall Time.
\item[Util.] This percentage is computed as CPU Usage divided by Good
Time.
\end{description}

Finally, \Condor{userlog} will display a summary for all hosts and
jobs.

\begin{Options}
    \OptItem{\Opt{-help}}{Get a brief description of the supported options}
    \OptItem{\Opt{-total}}{Only display job totals}
    \OptItem{\Opt{-raw}}{Display raw data only}
    \OptItem{\Opt{-debug}}{Debug mode}
    \OptItem{\Opt{-j}}{Select a specific cluster or cluster.proc}
    \OptItem{\Opt{-evict}}{Select only allocations which ended due to eviction}
    \OptItem{\Opt{-all}}{Select all clusters and all allocations}
    \OptItem{\Opt{-hostname}}{Display hostname instead of IP address}
\end{Options}

\GenRem
Since the Condor job log file format does not contain a year field in
the timestamp, all entries are assumed to occur in the current year.
Allocations which begin in one year and end in the next will be
silently ignored.
