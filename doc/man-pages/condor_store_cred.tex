\Description 

\Condor{store\_cred} stores the password of a user/domain pair securely
in the Windows registry.  Using this stored password, Condor is able to
run jobs with the user ID of the submitting user when running scheduler
universe jobs and DAGMan. In addition, Condor uses this password to
acquire the submitting user's credentials when writing output or log
files. The password is stored in the same manner as the system does when
setting or changing account passwords.

When \Condor{store\_cred} is invoked, it contacts the \Condor{schedd}
daemon to carry out the requested operations on behalf of the user.
This is necessary since registry keys are accessible only by the Windows
SYSTEM account, not by administrators or other users.

The password is stashed in a persistent manner; it is maintained
across system reboots.

\begin{Options}

	\OptItem{\Opt{add}}{Store the current user's password securely
	in the registry. The user is prompted to enter the password
	twice for confirmation, and characters are not echoed.	If there
	is already have a password stashed, the old password will be
	overwritten by the new password.}

	\OptItem{\Opt{delete}}{Delete the current user's
	stashed password, if it exists.}

	\OptItem{\Opt{query}}{Report whether the current user's password 
	is stored or not.}

	\OptItem{\Opt{-help}}{Displays a brief summary of command options.}

	\OptItem{\Opt{-p} password}{Stores given password rather than prompting.}

\end{Options}

\ExitStatus

\Condor{store\_cred} will exit with a status value of 0 (zero) upon success,
and it will exit with the value 1 (one) upon failure.
