\Description 

\Condor{reconfig} reconfigures all of the condor daemons in accordance with 
the current
status of the condor configuration file(s).  Once reconfiguration is complete,
the daemons will behave according to the policies stated in the configuration
file(s).  The only exception is with the DAEMON\_LIST variable, which will only be
updated if the \Condor{restart} command is used.  In general,
\Condor{reconfig} should be used when making changes to the configuration
files, since it is faster and more efficient then restarting the daemons.
