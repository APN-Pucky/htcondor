\Description 

\Condor{reconfig} reconfigures a set of the Condor daemons in
accordance with the current
status of the Condor configuration file(s) on a set of machines.
Once reconfiguration is complete,
the daemons will behave according to the policies
stated in the configuration file(s).
An exception is the \Attr{DAEMON\_LIST} variable, which will only be
updated if the \Condor{restart} command is used.
In general, \Condor{reconfig} should be used after making
changes to the configuration files,
since it is faster and more efficient than restarting the daemons.

The command 
\Condor{reconfig}
with no arguments or with the \Opt{-master} argument specifying
a daemon will cause the reconfiguration of the \Condor{master}
daemon and all the child processes of the \Condor{master}.

\ExitStatus

\Condor{reconfig} will exit with a status value of 0 (zero) upon success,
and it will exit with the value 1 (one) upon failure.

\Examples
To reconfigure the \Condor{master} and all its children
on the local host:
\begin{verbatim}
% condor_reconfig
\end{verbatim}

To reconfigure only the \Condor{startd} on a named machine:
\begin{verbatim}
% condor_reconfig -name bluejay -startd
\end{verbatim}

To reconfigure a machine within a pool
other than the local pool, use the \Opt{-pool} option.
The argument is the name of the central manager for the pool.
Note that one or more machines within the pool must be
specified as the targets for the command.
This command reconfigures
the single machine named \Opt{cae17} within the
pool of machines that has \Opt{condor.cae.wisc.edu} as
its central manager:
\begin{verbatim}
% condor_reconfig -pool condor.cae.wisc.edu -name cae17
\end{verbatim}
