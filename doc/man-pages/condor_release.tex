\Description

\Condor{release} releases one or more jobs in the condor job queue from hold state.  If a
cluster\_id and a process\_id are both specified, \Condor{release} attempts to
release the specified job. If a cluster\_id is specified
without a process\_id, \Condor{release} attempts to release all processes belonging
to the specified cluster. If a username is specified, \Condor{release} attempts to
release all jobs belonging to that user. Only the owner of a job, user condor,
or user root can release any given job.

When a job is released from hold state, it is returned to idle state, and will be scheduled
to run when possible. Only jobs that are on hold can be released.
