The quality of the Condor project is enhanced by the contributions
of external organizations.
We gratefully acknowledge the following contributions. 

\begin{itemize}

\item{The Globus Alliance} (\URL{http://www.globus.org}), 
for code and assistance in developing Condor-G
and the Grid Security Infrastructure (GSI)
for authentication and authorization. 

\item{The GOZAL Project}
from the Computer Science Department
of the Technion Israel Institute of Technology
(\URL{http://www.technion.ac.il/}),
for their enhancements for Condor's High Availability.
The \Condor{had} daemon allows one of multiple machines to function
as the central manager for a Condor pool.
Therefore, if an acting central manager fails,
another can take its place.
