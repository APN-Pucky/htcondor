condor_dagman 
version 1
May 15, 1998
joev@cs.wisc.edu

This version of DagMan does not use the DAG_LOG (the user log created by
the DagMan program) for recovery. It relies completely on the condor log
that was generated. 

It does create the DAG_LOG, although it doesn't use it. The DAG_LOG is
destroyed when the program exits, so the user will probably be unaware of
it's existance.

This version can be modified to support the UNDO command. This can be done
by adding another event to the condor log facility. When an UNDO command
is executed, this event will be registered in the condor log. 

Two flags can be defined in the Makefile - DEBUG and VERBOSE. Using DEBUG
will let the user see exactly how the data structures are being
manipulated and also the interaction between DagMan and Condor. Using
VERBOSE outputs important events, like SUBMIT_JOB and TERMINATE_JOB. Not
including either disables all output messages, other than the ones
generated by condor_submit. 

The Imakefile is used to generate the Makefile. Add or remove the flags,
and execute the command "condor_imake" in the working directory.
