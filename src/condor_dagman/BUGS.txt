? what happens if DAGMan is paused and someone or the schedd tries to
shut it down?  will ignoring it lead to trouble (i.e. hard kill)?  can
it be handled in mid-pause?  think...

- dagman doesn't dump pre/post script arguments to recovery DAGs!

- if condor_submit hangs (which it can), DAGMan hangs -- we need a timeout
