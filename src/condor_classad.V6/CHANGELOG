Changes for version 0.9.4: (not yet released)
* Added user-defined functions

* New parsing functions to allow input from different input types: C
  and C++ strings, streams, and files.

* Fixed some parsing bugs that could cause segfaults.

* Fixed a bug in evaluating function calls that could cause sefaults.

* Fixed bug in XML parsing that could cause problems for parsing empty
  strings, like <s></s>.

* Fixed error in evaluating lists. 

Changes for version 0.9.3: (released 1-Aug-2002)
* Made the standalone library compile with gcc 2.95.3, 2.96, and
  3.0.x. 

* You can define WANT_NAMESPACES, and the ClassAd library will be
  defined within the "classad" namespace now.

* Fixed a bug in views that could cause view members to be
  inadvertently erased. (bool ViewMemberLT::operator() was incorrect.)

* The ClassAd functions member and ismember switched the order of 
  parameters, and now match the documentation: the list argument
  is now second.

* bool EvaluateAttr(const string& attrName, Value &result) was declared
  in classad.h, but not defined. It now is. 

* Made IsStringValue() a bit safer in value.h

* There is a simple << operator for ClassAds now.

* New STL-like iterators for ClassAds and Collections. 

Changes for version 0.9.2: (released 12-Feb-2002)
* Setting the view info no longer loses the view name or parent
  view name.
* There is now a configure script to assist with building.

Changes for version 0.9.1:
* Fixed usage of va_end in debug.C
* Removed token after #endif
* Flushing of ClassAd collection logs was accidentally turned off, and
  is now turned back on.
* Fixed bug in ClassAd::Copy() where the parent scope wasn't being set
  properly.
