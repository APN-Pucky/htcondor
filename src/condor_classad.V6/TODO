===== Code =====
* Figure out cxi. Document it, add it to the distribution.

* Test printing values that are classads, lists, or times. 

* Test time representation

* There is a memory leak when using the . operator on lists. I fixed
  the memory leak (search for "need_delete" in and attrefs.C and look
  at the EvalState destructor in exprTree.C), but it causes some freed
  memory to be referenced, and I can't figure out why. Until I do, I
  would rather have a leak than to access freed memory. This should be fixed.

* Write or restrict copy constructors and assignment operators. 

* Make a SWIG interface so people can use ClassAds from scripting
  languages. SWIG supports Java, TCL, Python, Perl, and a couple
  more. http://www.swig.org/

* XML Output. Alain has plans for this.

* Convert absolute time to use ISO8601 time. Figure out how to include
  relative time in an appropriate way.

* Write some cool XSL to display XML ClassAds.

* Purify, purify, and purify again.

* Test partition views. 

===== Documentation ===== 
* Document how to have relative and absolute times in a classad
  directly. (Use the apostrophe.)

* Document using collections.

* Flesh out all of the doc++ comments to complete the documentation of
  the API. 

* Draw a class diagram to help people figure out the code.

===== test_classads =====
* Individual lexer test functions, to verify proper conversions?

* Figure out what to do for all of the EXCEPTs in the code. 

* Make dependencies for both internal use and for the makefile-dist

* Test that SetViewInfo preserves view name and parent view name.

* Write a separate test_xml?
