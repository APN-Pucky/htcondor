<h3>How condor's doc++ing works:</h3>

Each Imakefile in a directory that has no doc++ comments has one line
added.  That line is:
<pre>
docs:
</pre>

Each Imakefile in a directory with doc++ comments in it has a new target:
<pre>
doc_target( foo.h bar.h etc.h )
</pre>

Where the .h files listed contain doc++ stuff.<p>

Good examples of this are currently in condor_dagman 
and in condor_c++_util.<p>

When you write your own doc+ comments (hint, hint) add the above target to
your Imakefile.<p>

If you are in a subdirectory (like condor_dagman) and do a 
'<tt>make docs</tt>', the makefile will run doc++ on the listed 
.h files, and put the results into a subdirectory named '<tt>html</tt>'.
When '<tt>make docs</tt>' is run from the top level, this is done 
for all subdirectories.<p>

In that src/html directory, there is a perl script that Derek wrote.  It
looks through all the source to find the html subdirectories made in the
previous step.  It then spits out a web page (index.html) that has links
to all the source pages made by doc++.<p>

To run this perl script, do a '<tt>make htmldocs</tt>'<p>

Here is a summary of doc++ related make commands:
<ul>
 <li><tt>make html</tt> - you get the html directory built.
 <li><tt>make</tt>     - you get everything, including the html directory.
 <li><tt>make docs</tt> - you go into all subdirectories and get "make docs"
 <li><tt>make htmldocs</tt> - You get "make docs", then the perl script runs.
</ul>
