INTRODUCTION
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Tests in the Condor test suite can belong to various "classes" or
categories.  These classes are used to manage tests to allow building
and/or runing certain logical subsets of all the tests.  For example,
if you only want to run very short running tests, you might define a
class called "quick", and all tests that execute quickly would be
added to that class.  Similarly, very long running tests that we only
want to attempt to execute once a week could go into a seperate test
class called "weekly" or "long".  Defining test classes will allow
test authors a lot of flexibility in deciding when test should be
run and potentially how it is displayed.

DEFINING TEST CLASSES
----------------------------------------------------------------------

To define a test class, all you have to do is pick a name and start
adding tests to it.  To add a test to a given class, you add a
"TESTCLASS()" imake rule for that test and class to the appropriate
Imakefile.  For help with imake files and rules, see "README.imake". 
You don't have to seperately declare the class names or define them
anywhere, you just start using them.  The Condor imake build system is
smart enough to generate a file called "<classname>_list" that
contains all the testnames that belong to the given classname.
Additionally, it generates a file called "class_list", which contains
the names of all the valid test classes currently in use.

DESCRIPTION OF CURRENTLY USED TEST CLASSES
----------------------------------------------------------------------

quick        - very short-running tests
long	     - long-running tests that should run less frequently
