*   This module contains prototypes for prepackaged routines which are        *
*   commonly used by the Checkpoint Server.  Most of these routines use other *
*   "network" routines such as socket(), bind(), gethostbyname(), accept(),   *
*   listen(), etc.  However, most of these routines automatically trap        *
*   errors, and package specific pieces of information to pass back to the    *
*   calling routines.                                                         *
*                                                                             *
*   All of the routines in the server_network module are written in C as the  *
*   shadow processes also use some of these routines.                         *
*                                                                             *
