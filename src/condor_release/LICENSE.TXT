Internal Use License for Condor

This is an Internal Use License for Condor Version 6. This License is to be
signed by RECIPIENT (the "RECIPIENT"), and returned to the Condor Team at
the Computer Sciences Department of the University of Wisconsin-Madison (the
"PROVIDER"). The Condor Version 6 software program was developed by the
Condor Team. All rights, title, and interest in Condor Version 6 are owned
by the Condor Team. The subject computer program, including source code,
executables, and documentation shall be referred to as the "SOFTWARE."

RECIPIENT and PROVIDER agree as follows:

  1. Definitions.
       1. The "Object Code" of the SOFTWARE means the SOFTWARE assembled or
          compiled in magnetic or electronic binary form on software media,
          which are readable and usable by machines, but not generally
          readable by humans without reverse assembly, reverse compiling, or
          reverse engineering.
       2. The "Source Code" of the SOFTWARE means the SOFTWARE written in
          programming languages, such as C and FORTRAN, including all
          comments and procedural code, such as job control language
          statements, in a form intelligible to trained programmers and
          capable of being translated into Object Code for operation on
          computer equipment through assembly or compiling, and accompanied
          by documentation, including flow charts, schematics, statements of
          principles of operations, and architecture standards, describing
          the data flows, data structures, and control logic of the SOFTWARE
          in sufficient detail to enable a trained programmer through study
          of such documentation to maintain and/or modify the SOFTWARE
          without undue experimentation.
       3. A "Derivative Work" means a work that is based on one or more
          preexisting works, such as a revision, enhancement, modification,
          translation, abridgment, condensation, expansion, or any other
          form in which such preexisting works may be recast, transformed,
          or adapted, and that, if prepared without authorization of the
          owner of the copyright in such preexisting work, would constitute
          a copyright infringement. For purposes hereof, a Derivative Work
          shall also include any compilation that incorporates such a
          preexisting work. Unless otherwise provided in this License, all
          references to the SOFTWARE include any Derivative Works provided
          by PROVIDER or authorized to be made by RECIPIENT hereunder.
       4. "Support Materials" means documentation that describes the
          function and use of the SOFTWARE in sufficient detail to permit
          use of the SOFTWARE.

  2. Copying of SOFTWARE and Support Materials. PROVIDER grants RECIPIENT a
     non-exclusive, non-transferable use license to copy and distribute
     internally the SOFTWARE Object Code and related Support Materials in
     support of RECIPIENT's use of the SOFTWARE. RECIPIENT may not
     redistribute the SOFTWARE (electronically or otherwise) outside of
     thier own organization without PROVIDER's prior express authorization.

  3. Use of Object Code. PROVIDER grants RECIPIENT a royalty-free,
     non-exclusive, non-transferable use license in and to the SOFTWARE, in
     Object Code form only, to:
       1. Install the SOFTWARE at RECIPIENT's offices listed below;
       2. Use and execute the SOFTWARE for research or other internal
          purposes only;
       3. In support of RECIPIENT's authorized use of the SOFTWARE,
          physically transfer the SOFTWARE from one (1) computer to another;
          store the SOFTWARE's machine-readable instructions or data on a
          temporary basis in main memory, extended memory, or expanded
          memory of such computer system as necessary for such use; and
          transmit such instructions or data through computers and
          associated devices.

  4. Term of License. The term of this License shall not be limited in time.
     However, should the terms of this License not be followed, the PROVIDER
     may terminate this License. All copies of the SOFTWARE, or Derivative
     Works thereof, shall be destroyed by the RECIPIENT upon termination of
     this License.

  5. Derivative Works. Any modifications or Derivative Works based on the
     SOFTWARE shall be considered a part of the SOFTWARE and therefore shall
     be subject to the terms of this license. Derivative Works may be
     created and used by the RECEIPIENT, but may not be redistributed
     outside of the RECEIPIENT's organization.

  6. Limitations on Use, Etc. RECIPIENT may not use, copy, modify, or
     distribute the SOFTWARE (electronically or otherwise) or any copy,
     adaptation, transcription, or merged portion thereof, except as
     expressly authorized in this License. RECIPIENT's license may not be
     transferred, leased, assigned, or sublicensed without PROVIDER's prior
     express authorization.

  7. Data. RECIPIENT acknowledges that data conversion is subject to the
     likelihood of human and machine errors, omissions, delays, and losses,
     including inadvertent loss of data or damage to media, that may give
     rise to loss or damage. PROVIDER shall not be liable for any such
     errors, omissions, delays, or losses, whatsoever. RECIPIENT is also
     responsible for complying with all local, state, and federal laws
     pertaining to the use and disclosure of any data.

  8. The PROVIDER requests that any reports, publications, or other
     disclosure of results obtained with the SOFTWARE by the RECIPIENT will
     acknowledge its use by an appropriate citation. The appropriate
     reference for the SOFTWARE is "The Condor Software (Condor) was
     developed by the Condor Team at the University of Wisconsin-Madison
     Department of Computer Sciences."

  9. Warranty Disclaimer. RECIPIENT ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT: (A)
     NEITHER THE CONDOR TEAM NOR THE BOARD OF REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF
     WISCONSIN SYSTEM (REGENTS) MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES
     WHATSOEVER ABOUT THE SUITABILITY OF THE SOFTWARE FOR ANY PURPOSE; (B)

     AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NONINFRINGEMENT; (C) NEITHER
     THE CONDOR TEAM NOR THE REGENTS SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGE OR LOSS
     OF ANY KIND ARISING OUT OF OR RESULTING FROM RECIPIENT'S POSSESSION OR
     USE OF THE SOFTWARE (INCLUDING DATA LOSS OR CORRUPTION), REGARDLESS OF
     WHETHER SUCH LIABILITY IS BASED IN TORT, CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE; AND
     (D) NEITHER THE CONDOR TEAM NOR THE REGENTS HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO
     PROVIDE DEBUGGING, MAINTENANCE, SUPPORT, UPDATES, ENHANCEMENTS, OR
     MODIFICATIONS.

 10. Damages Disclaimer. RECIPIENT ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT IN NO EVENT
     WILL THE CONDOR TEAM OR THE REGENTS BE LIABLE TO RECIPIENT FOR ANY
     SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT OR SIMILAR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY LOST
     PROFITS OR LOST DATA ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
     SOFTWARE EVEN IF THE CONDOR TEAM OR THE REGENTS HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF
     THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

 11. Compliance with Applicable Laws. RECIPIENT agrees to abide by copyright
     law and all other applicable laws of the United States including, but
     not limited to, export control laws.

 12. U.S. Government Rights Restrictions. Use, duplication, or disclosure by
     the U.S. Government is subject to restrictions as set forth in
     subparagraph (c)(1)(ii) of The Rights in Technical Data and Computer
