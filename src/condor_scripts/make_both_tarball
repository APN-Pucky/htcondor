# This perl script is used by our build environment to build
# "both_tarballs", which are tarballs that use files from both the
# main release directory, and the contrib directory.  Files from the
# contrib directory are temporarily copied into the release
# directory.  If the release directory already contains one of these
# files (e.g. the condor_starter, where there are both "real" and
# contrib versions), the real version is stashed in a temporary
# location, and moved back in place when everything is finished.
# Once all the right files are assembled, the given tarball is
# created, and the release directory is cleaned up: contrib versions
# are deleted, and if they conflicted with a real version, the real
# version is moved back into place, and the directory tree used to
# save real versions is deleted.
