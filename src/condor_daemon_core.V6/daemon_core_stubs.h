	The following are dummy stubs for the DaemonCore class to allow
	tools using DCSchedd to link.  DaemonCore is brought in
	because of the FileTransfer object.
	These stub functions will become obsoluete once we start linking
	in the real DaemonCore library with the tools, -or- once
	FileTransfer is broken down.

	This file should be #included at the end of a source file which must use
	DCSchedd, but not link with daemoncore.
