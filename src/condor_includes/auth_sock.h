/** AuthSock is an authenticated subclass of Cedar's ReliSock class.
    An AuthSock is NOT authenticated until the successful return of the
    AuthSock::authenticate() method.
    AuthSock subclasses Cedar's ReliSock socket communications methods
    to provide authentication services over Cedar's modified sockets.
    It uses Globus' Generic Security Service-API implementation based
    on RFC 2078. Globus (and therefore, Condor) uses SSL-eay, an 
    implementation of Secure Sockets Layer, for X.509 certificate 
    generation, administration, and verification.

    To use AuthSock, you must define these the following environment 
    variables (pseudo-code samples are shown):
	 	CONDOR_GATEKEEPER=/CN=schedd@hostname.cs.wisc.edu (CLIENT ONLY)
    	X509_CERT_DIR=$HOME/CertClient
    	X509_USER_CERT=$HOME/CertClient/newcert.pem
    	X509_USER_KEY=$HOME/CertClient/private/newreq.pem
    
    AuthSock provides the same interface as ReliSock, with the addition
    of two methods: authenticate_user( void ) and authenticate( void ),
    so any or all instances of ReliSock can be replaced with AuthSock.
    In fact, on platforms where GSS-API and SSL-eay are not available,
    AuthSock is simply defined as ReliSock in a #define statement.
