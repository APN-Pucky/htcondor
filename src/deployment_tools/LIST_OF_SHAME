LIST OF SHAME
==============
1. condor_local_stop needs to query the collector to shut off the
   master in the dynamic case
   - normally condor_off uses the config to find the masters address
   file, which is usually stored in log/
   - if -dyn is used then the location of log/ cannot be computed from
   the config files.  Therefore condor_off lookups up the IP for the
   master from the collector
   - Possible Solution: Tree of collectors
     + a collector for each machine, with its port listed in config
     + the machine collector aggregates info for the machine and sends
       it to its parent collector

2. condor_cold_start does not allow the setup process to install local
   configs
   - this requires configMD to bind the local config files into the
     global config (the global config can't know the location of the
     local configs until after they are installed, environment variables
     won't work for this)
   - Adding ConfigMD will move functionality out of local_start,
     namely LB_RELEASE_DIR

3. condor_install_release does not work with GSI

5. Warnings: Warnings are kind of glommed together.  Its like endlines
   don't work.
   - Maybe just write directly to stderr and use endlines

6. cold_stop: If a specified configuration files installed version is
   not in the expected location, cold stop uses the original version
   (specified as a file path or a url).  If the path is specified as a
   url, this will fail strangely.

7. condor_local_start's prediagnosis is very specific for schedd.  We
   may want to use config variables or something else to make this
   work for non-scheduler installs

8. condor_local_stop is also very schedd specific.  It will not
   shutdown if the schedd still has jobs.

9. condor_install_local will not handle arbitrarily named log, exec,
   spool directories with its install from archive option

10. condor_cleanup_local doesn't work with dynamically named local
    dirs
