DEBUGGING
----------------------------------------------------------------------

For debugging the shadow, you can put: "ShadowWaitForDebug = 1" in
your job ad.  If the shadow sees this attribute in the job ad, it will
put itself into an infinite loop as soon as possible after getting the
job ad from the schedd.  Then, you can attach with a debugger, set
"shadow_should_wait" to 0, and continue.
