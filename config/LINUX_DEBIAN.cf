/* Things specific to LINUX_DEBIAN machines */

/* Due to two problems we turn off the full port for Debian:

	1. -fstack-protect has a support library that our glibc doesn't have and
		we need to copy its functionality for standard universe to link.

	2. C++ exception handling in stdc++ assumes that the glibc is compiled
		with TLS, but ours isn't and doesn't compile out of the box with
		TLS.
