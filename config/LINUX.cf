		them against the glibc that we manually create which has
		nss statically linked in. However, on redhat 9, the rpm
		build of the static nss glibc differed from the system
		glibc in that they seemingly had different feature sets.
		The system glibc had run time signals, the hand built
		one did not, and no deciphering of the build arguments
		could determine what the incantation was to make the
		feature sets be identical.  Since variables came and
		went in certain .o files based upon this real time signal
		stuff, the extracted system .o could be using an undefined
		variable that the hand built glibc now never defines. Or
		vice versa.  This would cause .o files to be brought in
		multiple times from either libc as the two versions of
		the .o file fought over who defined what and where.

		A long time ago, we wondered if the extracting libc should
		be the same libc that we link a standard universe
		job against. The answer as of this checkin is now
		"yes". --psilord 12/09/03 */
