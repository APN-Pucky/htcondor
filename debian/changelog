condor (7.5.5+git995-ga9a0d2a-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * New upstream code from V7.6 branch. Updated various patches, removed some
    merged ones.
  * No longer compile the 'contrib' parts -- upstream recommended it due to
    lack of stability.
  * Added patch to create /var/run/condor upon daemon startup with proper
    permissions. That helps to conform to the FHS that declares /var/run as
    volatile and to be cleaned upon boot. Moreover, some systems have /var/run
    mounted as tmpfs.

    configuration file.
