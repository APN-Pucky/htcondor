condor (7.7.1+git436-g81fc261-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * New upstream code. Support for dynamic linking against system
    libraries.
  * Fix build-deps on BOOST.
  * Bumped Standards-version to 3.9.2; no changes necessary.
  * Build using embedded classad library -- upstream will (or did) stop
    releasing it separately. libclassad binary packages are now built from
    the Condor source package.
  * Drop shared library, sysapi and postgres patches -- merged or obsolete.
  * Adjust rules for now included doc source code.
  * Add sanity checks into maintainer script to avoid creating bogus
    directories and installation errors. Thanks to Mats Rynge for reporting.
  * Add Python as runtime dependency.
  * Add patch to make condor_run work with Condor's new file transfer
    behavior. Courtesy of Jaime Frey.
  * Stop building a PDF version of the manual (takes long, and segfaults
    ghostscript at the moment). Keep HTML version.

condor (7.5.5+git995-ga9a0d2a-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * New upstream code from V7.6 branch. Updated various patches, removed some
    merged ones.
  * No longer compile the 'contrib' parts -- upstream recommended it due to
    lack of stability.
  * Added patch to create /var/run/condor upon daemon startup with proper
    permissions. That helps to conform to the FHS that declares /var/run as
    volatile and to be cleaned upon boot. Moreover, some systems have /var/run
    mounted as tmpfs.

condor (7.5.4+git567-gb10f6b4-2) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

    Matthew Farrellee <matt@redhat.com>.
  * Improved configuration for a "Personal Condor". Bind network traffic to
    the loopback interface. Better documentation in the generated
    configuration file.
