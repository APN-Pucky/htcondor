* Do license checks
* Support systems that have tmpfs on /var/run
  This is not the default on Debian (but Ubuntu may have it)

* debconf config doesn't work on first run when doing an install from scratch
* debconf templates should mention format things: comma-separated list, ...
* Allow for configurable UID/GID
* Security: ALLOW_ADVERTISE_SCHEDD
* Incompatible with GSOAP 2.8.*
* Check the install logs. There are some 'permission denied' messages. Some
  files are not installed into proper locations.
* Something is wrong with
  BIND_ALL_INTERFACES = FALSE
  NETWORK_INTERFACE =  127.0.0.1
  The collector still listens on the external interface (only)
